Welcome to the Slackware Linux installation disk! (version 12.2)

######  IMPORTANT! READ THE INFORMATION BELOW CAREFULLY.  ######

- You will need one or more partitions of type 'Linux' prepared. It is also
  recommended that you create a swap partition (type 'Linux swap') prior
  to installation. For more information, run 'setup' and read the help file.

- If you're having problems that you think might be related to low memory, you
  can try activating a swap partition before you run setup. After making a
  swap partition (type 82) with cfdisk or fdisk, activate it like this:
    mkswap /dev/<partition> ; swapon /dev/<partition>

- Once you have prepared the disk partitions for Linux, type 'setup' to begin
  the installation process.

You may now login as 'root'.
