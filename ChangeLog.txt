Slackware 13.0 x86_64 is released as stable!  Thanks to everyone who
helped make this release possible -- see the RELEASE_NOTES for the
credits.  The ISOs are off to the replicator.  This time it will be a
6 CD-ROM 32-bit set and a dual-sided 32-bit/64-bit x86/x86_64 DVD.
We're taking pre-orders now at store.slackware.com.  Please consider
picking up a copy to help support the project.  Once again, thanks to
the entire Slackware community for all the help testing and fixing
things and offering suggestions during this development cycle.
As always, have fun and enjoy!  -P.

    Don't use unsigned (fix unsigned comparison warning).
    Bump patchlevel.
  Thanks to Gary Carvell.
Added 2.6.30.5 generic Linux kernel packages in /testing.  Release time
is getting close, so we're sticking with the 2.6.29.6 kernels as the main
kernels for Slackware 13.0.  Besides, we know of at least one tricky issue
with 2.6.30.x and the LILO bootloader, and the workaround that we know of
likely isn't going to work on BIOSes older than 2001.  Be sure to read the
README_FIRST.TXT (really!) in the directory with the kernel packages if you
intend to try these.

xap/pidgin-2.5.9-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes a bug in Pidgin's MSN protocol implementation can allow
  a remote attacker to send a malicious MSN message to a Pidgin user, which
  will possibly cause arbitrary code to be executed as that user.
  This issue was discovered by Federico Muttis of Core Security Technologies.
  For more information, see:
    http://www.coresecurity.com/content/libpurple-arbitrary-write
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2694
  (* Security fix *)
+--------------------------+
Tue Aug 18 18:50:46 CDT 2009
  Patched kernels and kernel packages for Linux 2.6.29.6 to address
  a bug in proto_ops structures which could allow a user to use the
  kernel sendpage operation to execute arbitrary code in page zero.
  This could allow local users to gain escalated privileges.
  This flaw was discovered by Tavis Ormandy and Julien Tinnes of the
  Google Security Team.
  For more information, see:
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2692
  In addition, these kernels change the CONFIG_SECURITY_DEFAULT_MMAP_MIN_ADDR
  kernel config option value to 4096, which should prevent the execution
  of arbitrary code by future NULL dereference bugs that might be found
  in the kernel.  If you are compiling your own kernel, please check this
  option in your .config.  If it is set to =0, you may wish to edit it
  to 4096 (or some other value > 0) and then reconfigure, or the kernel
  will not have default protection against zero page attacks from
  userspace.

  This update fixes a security issue where a zero byte embedded in an SSL
  or TLS certificate could fool cURL into validating the security of a
  connection to a system that the certificate was not issued for.  It has
  been reported that at least one Certificate Authority allowed such
  certificates to be issued.

  xfig-3.2.4.
t/xfig-3.2.4-x86_64-4.txz:  Reverted.  This is due to xfig-3.2.5b not working
  correctly.  .fig files will load, but making any changes causes xfig to
  hang consuming 100% CPU.  We couldn't find a fix, and honestly RC2 just
  wasn't a good time to upgrade xfig (3.2.4 also required many patches to
  work right).  Sorry, but we'll look at this again in the next -current.

Hi folks!  We're going to call this set of updates RC2.  There are still
README files to be handled (that's the nature of documentation, I guess), as
well as some other things remaining on the TODO list, but X seems pretty
stable now, and it seems like a release soon would be in order so that we
can march right back into development territory with -current again soon.  :-)
Enjoy, and let us know about any problems you run into!

  We know about qt-copy.git and plan to adopt it sometime after the 13.0
  release, but would like to stick to close to the same Qt branch that
  KDE 4.2.4 was developed on for now.
n/fetchmail-6.3.11-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.

    The bundled copy of the APR-util library has been updated, fixing three
    different security issues which may affect particular configurations
    and third-party modules.
  These last three CVEs were addressed in Slackware previously with an
  update to new system apr and apr-util packages.

Hi folks -- the TODO isn't entirely empty here, but it's pretty much down
to minor nits, and so we're going to call this release candidate #1 and
(mostly) freeze further updates unless they happen to fix problems.
Regarding the kernel, 2.6.29.x has been well tested with this userspace
and seems like the best choice to ship for production use.  Perhaps we
can put something else (at least source and configs) in /testing, though.
a/slocate-3.1-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.  Don't index cifs or tmpfs.
  Add a few more directories to the list of paths to prune.

  Well, actually more like "switched", or "reverted".  After many hours
  trying to track down the reason for reported instability with X and
  compositing (such as crashes when adjusting advanced desktop settings in
  KDE), we've found that it seems to happen only with MesaLib 7.4.2.  Rather
  than trying to cherry-pick changes between 7.4.1 and 7.4.2, we've switched
  to shipping 7.4.1 in the main tree, and have not run into any such problems
  since making the switch.  If people want to continue testing 7.4.2, we've
  moved it into /testing.  Let us know if you run into any problems with
  7.4.1 that are fixed with 7.4.2, and we'll take a look at individual diffs.

This batch of updates includes a major overhaul of X.Org -- thanks to Robby
Workman for doing a huge amount of work updating the build scripts and testing
everything.  A large number of packages were recompiled or upgraded to drop
references to the now-obsolete libxcb-xlib and libXaw8 libraries.  We have
workarounds in place for old binaries so it wasn't strictly required, but
recompiling anyway gives a cleaner system.  Enjoy!

  restore foomatic-rip-hplip, as some printers still don't work using the
  regular foomatic-rip filter.  This might require your PPDs to be regenerated
  by removing the printer and reinstalling it.  Thanks to Robby Workman.

  remote NTP server.
  Stack-based buffer overflow in the crypto_recv function in ntp_crypto.c in
  ntpd in NTP before 4.2.4p7 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.
  This does not affect the Slackware ntpd as it does not link with openssl.

<tick> <tick> Ermm... is this thing on?

Initial public release of Slackware64-current.
He's trying to lay low, but thanks to Eric Hameleers for the huge amount
of work he did to make this possible.  :-)

Enjoy!
