# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

kinit: kinit (startup helper library)
kinit:
kinit: kdeinit is a process launcher somewhat similar to the famous init used
kinit: for booting. It launches processes by forking and then loading a
kinit: dynamic library which should contain a 'kdemain(...)' function. Using
kinit: kdeinit to launch KDE applications makes starting a typical KDE
kinit: application 2.5 times faster and reduces memory consumption.
