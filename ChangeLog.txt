Slackware 13.37 x86_64 stable is released!

Thanks to everyone who pitched in on this release: the Slackware team,
the folks producing upstream code, and linuxquestions.org for providing
a great forum for collaboration and testing.

The ISOs are off to be replicated, a 6 CD-ROM 32-bit set and a dual-sided
32-bit/64-bit x86/x86_64 DVD.  Please consider supporting the Slackware
project by picking up a copy from store.slackware.com.  We're taking
pre-orders now, and offer a discount if you sign up for a subscription.

As always, thanks to the Slackware community for testing, suggestions,
and feedback.  :-)

Have fun!

l/sdl-1.2.14-x86_64-5.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Patched to fix a crash related to a changed struct in the Linux kernel.
  Thanks to wadsworth.
+--------------------------+
Sun Apr 24 03:20:33 UTC 2011
I'd best start wrapping this up or I'm likely to be eaten by a grue.
a/sysvinit-scripts-1.2-noarch-43.txz:  Rebuilt.
  The block loop device has long been built into the Slackware kernel (since
  1993, in fact), but we plan to make it modular in future kernels in the main
  tree, and it already is modular in the /testing kernels.  To avoid surprises,
  we'll load it at boot time if it is modular and not loaded already.
  /etc/rc.d/rc.loop:  Added a simple script to load the loop device module.
  /etc/rc.d/rc.S:  Run the rc.loop script if it is executable.
l/jre-6u25-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
extra/fvwm-2.6.1/fvwm-2.6.1-x86_64-1.txz:  Added.
  The location for the system config file moves to /etc, and there isn't one
  included yet for fvwm-2.6.x.  But that makes it more fun, right?  :-)
extra/jdk-6/jdk-6u25-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.

  Thanks to Steve Kennedy for pointing this out, as it fixes a possible crash.
testing/source/linux-2.6.35.12-configs/:  Added.
  Just in case anyone is intending to follow the longterm branch of the Linux
  kernel, here are some sample .config files that may be a useful starting
  point.  I imagine most people who would want to run this would be using it
  on a server, so a few options were tweaked to optimize it for that.
  Some of the highlights versus the previous 2.6.35.11 configs:
    BLK_DEV_LOOP y -> m
    FIREWIRE n -> m
    HZ 1000 -> 100
    MOUSE_PS2_ELANTECH n -> y
    PHONET m -> n
    PREEMPT_NONE n -> y
    PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY y -> n

  Thanks to Audrius Kazukauskas.
l/t1lib-5.1.2-x86_64-1.txz:  Removed.
  There is little use these days for Type 1 fonts and the library is not
  maintained.  If anyone really needs this, fetch it from Slackware 13.1.

a/btrfs-progs-20110327-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  In fsck.btrfs script, don't check a filesystem that's mounted as /, even if
  it is mounted read-only.  This fix allows using btrfs as a root filesystem,
  but /boot will still need to be on another partition using ext2 (or some
  other filesystem) as btrfs is tricky to boot directly.
  Thanks to gerasimos_h.

  will work better for Speakup installs, too.  Thanks to Skaperen on LQ.

  It is time to push this into the main tree.  It's unlikely that we'll see
  significant changes prior to Firefox 4.0 final.  Probably the first security
  fixes for the Firefox 4.0 branch will come with Firefox 4.0.1, which is the
  branch that we'll want to be tracking in Slackware 13.37's /patches.  If for
  some reason you want to stick with Firefox 3.6.x, it will be tracked in
  Slackware 13.1's /patches for as long as they support it upstream.

Hey folks, I think it's time for Slackware 13.37 (hopefully this helps
make up for our lack of code names) release candidate 1!
After a lot of testing and consideration, we've decided to go with the
recently released 2.6.37.3 Linux kernel which seems to work best for X,
contains support for Speakup, and looks like a better kernel branch to
be using as we move forward.
Please test so we can have a stable release soon.  :-)

  issues are also fixed in those external libraries.

x/mesa-7.9_ccc11aa-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  The Mesa 7.9 branch seems to be a little more stable, but feel free to
  try out the 7.10 package in /testing.
x/xf86-video-ati-6.14.0-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This new driver requires KMS, which is set by default in the new kernel.
  Otherwise, create /etc/modprobe.d/radeon.conf with this content:
    options radeon modeset=1
  Also, the kernel should be booted with vga=normal.
  Problems have been observed when trying to use KMS after starting a VESA
  framebuffer console.  Sorry about the penguins.

  Provide an alternate ATI driver in case of problems with the latest one.
testing/packages/mesa-7.10_92a619b-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  There have been some strange bugs reported with Mesa-7.10, and on my own
  machine I have noticed occasional freezes when X is running, even at the
  text console.  These effects are not happening when Mesa-7.9 is used
  instead, so we'll put Mesa-7.10 in /testing for now.

  This package replaces the xf86-video-nouveau with a config file in
  /etc/modprobe.d/ that prevents the kernel from loading the nouveau driver.
  You'll want to use this instead of the xf86-video-nouveau package in xap/ if
  you plan on using the proprietary X driver from nVidia.

n/proftpd-1.3.3d-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes an unbounded copy operation in sql_prepare_where() that
  could be exploited to execute arbitrary code.  However, this only affects
  servers that use the sql_mod module (which Slackware does not ship), and
  in addition the ability to exploit this depends on an SQL injection bug
  that was already fixed in proftpd-1.3.2rc2 (this according to upstream).
  So in theory, this fix should only be of academic interest.
  But in practice, better safe than sorry.

  I was on the fence with this upgrade, and in fact it sat in /testing for
  days with mesa-7.8.2 queued instead.  But it seems the Intel driver really
  does need this version of Mesa or there are major problems with compositing
  (most of them leading to an X server crash).
  If X crashes at start, try disabling compositing.  Create a file named
  /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/disable-composite.conf with this in it:
    Section "Extensions"
      Option "Composite" "Disable"
    EndSection
  The machine that had issues here was using an onboard nVidia 6150SE.
  Using the nv, nouveau, or even the vesa driver, X crashed at start unless
  compositing was disabled.  However, everything works perfectly when using
  the binary nVidia drivers, and odds are that most users with decent nVidia
  hardware are doing just that.  So, that's the situation with nVidia and
  Mesa as observed here for now.  Hopefully the defaults will work better
  soon, but meanwhile if you have nVidia hardware you may have to either
  disable compositing or obtain and use nVidia's binary drivers.

ap/sudo-1.7.4p4-x86_64-3.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Hi folks, since the patches for old systems (8.1 - 10.2) were briefly
  available containing a /var/lib with incorrect permissions, I'm issuing
  these again just to be 100% sure that no systems out there will be left
  with problems due to that.  This should do it (third time's the charm).

ap/sudo-1.7.4p4-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  The last sudo packages accidentally changed the permissions on /var from
  755 to 700.  This build restores the proper permissions.
  Thanks to Petri Kaukasoina for pointing this out.

ap/alsa-utils-1.0.23-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Patched alsaconf to generate /etc/modprobe.d/sound.conf.
  Thanks to Alan Hicks.
kde/kdebase-workspace-4.4.3-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Patched xinitrc.kde to launch with ck-launch-session only if the
  DESKTOP_SESSION variable is empty.  This fixes a bug where a ck-aware
  login manager such as KDM may have already launched a ConsoleKit
  session, causing the xinitrc to launch another one and marking the
  first one inactive.  This can lead to auth failures.
  Thanks to Robby Workman.
