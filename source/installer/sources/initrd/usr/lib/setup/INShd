In order to install directly from the hard disk you must have a
partition (such as /dev/sda1, /dev/sdb5, etc) with the Slackware
distribution's slackware/ directory like you'd find it on the FTP
site. It can be in another directory. For example, if the
distribution is in /stuff/slackware/, then you have to have
directories named /stuff/slackware/a, /stuff/slackware/ap, and so
on each containing the files that would be in that directory on
the FTP site. You may install from FAT or Linux partitions.

Please enter the partition (such as /dev/sda1) where the Slackware
sources can be found, or [enter] to see a partition list:

Sorry, but the directory $SLACK_SOURCE_LOCATION does not exist

Would you like to try again?
