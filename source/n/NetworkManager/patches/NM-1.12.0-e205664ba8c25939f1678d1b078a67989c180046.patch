Subject: [PATCH] manager: accept non-null device for VPN activations

Commit 10753c36168a ("manager: merge VPN handling into
_new_active_connection()") added a check to fail the activation of
VPNs when a device is passed to ActivateConnection(), since the device
argument is ignored for VPNs.

This broke activating VPNs from nm-applet as nm-applet sets both the
specific_object (parent-connection) and device arguments in the
activation request.

Note that we already check in _new_active_connection() that when a
device is supplied, it matches the device of the parent
connection. Therefore, the check can be dropped.
