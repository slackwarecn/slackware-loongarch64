# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

kplotting: kplotting (Data plotting)
kplotting:
kplotting: KPlotWidget is a QWidget-derived class that provides a virtual base
kplotting: class for easy data-plotting. The idea behind KPlotWidget is that you
kplotting: only have to specify information in data units; i.e., the natural
kplotting: units of the data being plotted. KPlotWidget automatically converts
kplotting: everything to screen pixel units. KPlotWidget draws X and Y axes with
kplotting: tick marks and tick labels, and automatically determines how many tick
kplotting: marks to use and where they should be, based on the data limits
kplotting: specified for the plot.
