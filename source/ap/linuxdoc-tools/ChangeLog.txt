 linuxdoc-tools 0.9.66, build 2.
 * Applied an upstream patch to gtk-doc-1.13, fixing problems
   with gtkdoc-fixxref.
 * Updated build script to work with the new rpm2tgz which now
   packages all src RPM contents into the root of the tar archive 
   rather than a sub directory.

 linuxdoc-tools-0.9.56, build 5.
 * Replace /usr/share/xml/docbook/xml-dtd-4.5/ent/isogrk4.ent with
   the Unicode-4 entity map from sgml-common, to fix errors such as
   ""1D6C2" is not a character number in the document character set"
   Thanks to Niels Horn for the fix and Ron Parker for the report.

 linuxdoc-tools-0.9.56, build 4.
* Upgraded to:
   docbook-xsl-1.75.1
   docbook-xsl-doc-1.75.1
   gnome-doc-utils-0.17.2
   asciidoc-8.4.5
   OpenJade-1.3.3-pre1

This package has a problem producing simple docbook documents
though, as reported by Ron Parker.

 For example:
  # cat << EOF > /tmp/test.txt
Hello
this will not work yet
EOF
  # asciidoc -b docbook  /tmp/test.txt
  # db2rtf /tmp/test.xml
You'll see this error:
jade:/usr/share/xml/docbook/xml-dtd-4.5/ent/isogrk4.ent:42:30:E: "1D6C2" is not a character number in the document character set

I've been reading a few URLs:
http://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/docbook-apps/200511/msg00119.html
http://bugs.gentoo.org/238785

The majority of the build process for Docbook and supporting tools
is taken verbatim from Linux From Scratch:
http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/index.html
I have in the past looked at Fedora and Debian spec & rules files
but LFS has great documentation and makes maintaining this package
a lot easier, so I'm very keen to keep to their build process
(including file/directory paths) as much as possible.

If anybody knows how to resolve this, please let me know!

 linuxdoc-tools-0.9.56, build 3.
 * Remove orphaned *.pyc (Python compiled) files.
   The addition of GNOME doc-tools causes some Python *.py
   files to be recompiled, resulting in them appearing in this
   package. These files belonged to the Python package and 
   therefore caused an overlap.

 linuxdoc-tools-0.9.56, build 2.
 * Added missing asciidoc filters.
   Thanks to 'one forall' for the report.
   Now use asciidoc's 'make install' target to install
   rather than hand crafted script.

 linuxdoc-tools-0.9.21, build 4
  * Converted from docbook RPM source builds to direct source build, with
    the build script code by: Jerome Pinot
    based on the Linux From Scratch documentation.
    Merged some of Jerome's code back into the original linuxdoc-tools.build
    script.
    This fixes many bugs with the previous package, with broken catalogs
    and so on.
  * Upgraded to gtk-doc v1.8
  * Upgraded to DocBook SGML DTD v4.5
  * Upgraded to DocBook DSSSL Stylesheets v1.79
  * Upgraded to DocBook XML DTD v4.5
  * Upgraded to DocBook XSL Stylesheets v1.72.0 & docs
  * Added AsciiDoc v8.2.1
  * Added xmlto v0.0.18
  * Removed unused build script code cruft from linuxdoc-tools.build 
  * Re-ordered the build script since OpenSP v1.5.2 requires xmlto,
    and xmlto requires the docbook stuff to be installed.
  * Removed buildDocBookCatalog script.  If you delete your system's SGML or XML
    catalog scripts, thinking that this script can repopulate them, it won't.
    If you're adding docbook data to your system, you need to read the docs that
    come with the new data you're installing.
  * Thanks to Red Hat for the loan of a laptop on which to test this build ;-)
