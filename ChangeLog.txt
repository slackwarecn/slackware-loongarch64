  This update fixes security issues:
  There was a long-existing flaw in the documentation for ms-self, krb5-self,
  ms-subdomain, and krb5-subdomain rules in update-policy statements. Though
  the policies worked as intended, operators who configured their servers
  according to the misleading documentation may have thought zone updates were
  more restricted than they were; users of these rule types are advised to
  review the documentation and correct their configurations if necessary. New
  rule types matching the previously documented behavior will be introduced in
  a future maintenance release.
  named could crash during recursive processing of DNAME records when
  deny-answer-aliases was in use. This flaw is disclosed in CVE-2018-5740.

   A potentially exploitable crash in TransportSecurityInfo used for SSL
   can be triggered by data stored in the local cache in the user profile
   directory. This issue is only exploitable in combination with another
   vulnerability allowing an attacker to write data into the local cache
   or from locally installed malware. This issue also triggers a
   non-exploitable startup crash for users switching between the Nightly
   and Release versions of Firefox if the same profile is used.

a/sysvinit-scripts-2.1-noarch-20.txz:  Rebuilt.
  rc.6: it was reported by birdboy that JFS is not properly unmounted unless
  the order of unmounting local filesystems followed by remounting the root
  filesystem read-only is inverted. I tried that, and although it did get rid
  of a "/ filesystem is busy" error during shutdown, the JFS / filesystem was
  still checked at boot (and found to be clean). I believe that the existing
  order of unmounting non-root filesystems followed by remounting the root
  filesystem as read-only is the correct order, and found that putting
  another sync between these also gets rid of the error on shutdown, so I've
  done that. When using JFS as the root filesystem there's still another
  similar error message that's generated earlier in the boot, though. I'm
  unable to find any way to shut down a JFS root partition in a way that
  leaves it clean enough that fsck will not check it at boot, but it is always
  found to be clean so this should only be cosmetic. I recall this behavior of
  JFS going all the way back to when it was first added to the kernel. If
  anyone has a better fix, I'll take a look at it, but in my opinion it's not
  really anything to worry about.
ap/ghostscript-9.25-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.

  Use the ter-114v terminus font. It has been reported that the font we were
  using (ter-v14v) restricts the available console colors from 16 to 8 due
  to needing an extra bit for the higher number of available glyphs (though
  in testing here I couldn't see any difference). The new font covers
  ISO8859-1, ISO8859-15, and Windows-1252 codepages. I'm still not sure it's
  the best choice, so additional input is welcomed.

a/sysvinit-2.90-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  sysvinit-2.90 added an undocumented feature that tries to spawn agetty
  if it sees console= in the kernel command line. Avoiding the debate about
  whether this code belongs in init at all, at least such a change should
  be documented, and probably made opt-in. This patch disables the new
  behavior unless "sysvinit_agetty" is also seen in the kernel command line.
  It seems like this might have been something added for Hurd, and it might
  be wise to stick to what we've got rather than following upstream on this
  particular package. If anyone notices any other odd behavior, please let
  me know. Thanks to shastah.

n/ntp-4.2.8p12-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This release improves on one security fix in ntpd:
    LOW/MEDIUM: Sec 3012: Sybil vulnerability: ephemeral association attack
    While fixed in ntp-4.2.8p7 and with significant additional protections for
    this issue in 4.2.8p11, ntp-4.2.8p12 includes a fix for an edge case in
    the new noepeer support. Originally reported by Matt Van Gundy of Cisco.
    Edge-case hole reported by Martin Burnicki of Meinberg.
  And fixes another security issue in ntpq and ntpdc:
    LOW: Sec 3505: The openhost() function used during command-line hostname
    processing by ntpq and ntpdc can write beyond its buffer limit, which
    could allow  an attacker to achieve code execution or escalate to higher
    privileges via a long string as the argument for an IPv4 or IPv6
    command-line parameter. NOTE: It is unclear whether there are any common
    situations in which ntpq or ntpdc is used with a command line from an
    untrusted source. Reported by Fakhri Zulkifli.

  It has been discovered that lftp up to and including version 4.8.3 does
  not properly sanitize remote file names, leading to a loss of integrity
  on the local system when reverse mirroring is used. A remote attacker
  may trick a user to use reverse mirroring on an attacker controlled FTP
  server, resulting in the removal of all files in the current working
  directory of the victim's system.

  shipped. This meant that any user with access to the D-Bus system bus was
  able to access the related API without authentication. The result was an
  unspecified impact on the networking stack.
  Thanks to Matthias Gerstner for discovering this issue.

testing/packages/glibc-2.28-x86_64-1.txz:  Added.
  These packages are in /testing pending FTBFS analysis. They seem to work
  fine here, but with a few header file deprecations and some other
  possible API changes and incompatibilities (see the NEWS file), I expect
  there will be some changes required to various packages. Feel free to
  test them out though. Because of changes to the way glibc is built and
  installed that started with the glibc-2.27 packages, you can upgrade to
  these packages and also (if you wish) downgrade back to glibc-2.27 using
  upgradepkg.

Hey folks, my first order of business here needs to be a huge thank you to
everyone who has donated at https://paypal.me/volkerdi to help keep this
project going. As most of you are already aware by now, the financal situation
here at Slackware HQ has not been great for many years, including not getting
any pay for the last two years and forcing me (and my family) to live very
frugally while I continued to work on the project hoping I'd figure out a way
to actually monitize it by the time that Slackware 15.0 is ready for release.
I'm not trying to cast any blame regarding the situation. Really, I can only
blame myself for not trying to build my own ship years ago when things began
to not really work out. I'm still looking into sustainable funding options
such as Patreon or Liberapay (or perhaps both), and I'm open to other ideas.
I'm no longer in immediate danger of going broke, and I'm no longer
entertaining the notion of joining my friends at the local potato chip factory
in order to pay my bills. :) My family is grateful and humbled by the support
we've received. Hope we'll be able to keep this project going for a long time.
Also, I realize that the website lacks updates and needs attention and I will
need to find some time to devote to that. I've never been much of a website
designer, and the slackware.com site is basically left over from work done by
former Walnut Creek / BSDi employees. I've never seen able to make much sense
of the SQL backend. The interface to edit and post articles is clunky (and
I'm not sure the PHP for that even works any more). When I've posted articles
in recent years, I've done so by editing the main page already processed from
PHP into HTML, which is pretty darn messy as I'm sure you can imagine. I tend
to prioritize the distribution itself over other demands on my time - that's
clearly a lot to do with how things ended up the way they did.
So, I guess that's the report for now. Lots more work to do and not enough
time to do it in... that part I don't see changing moving forward. :)
Thanks very much again. I'll do my best to keep you all posted.
  - Pat

  Autobind secondary GPUs to the master as output sink / offload source. This
  seems like a beneficial patch until/unless DEs start to handle this.
  For nvidia cards, if they are GeForce 8 or newer use the modesetting driver
  by default. Seems to be recommmended by upstream where they indicate that
  fixes going into nouveau are primarily to target older cards for legacy
  support and that the modesetting ddx is preferable for newer ones:

Happy 25th anniversary to the Slackware 1.00 release! When the original
announcement went out on Usenet, I believe it had a UTC timestamp which has
led to some confusion over whether the anniversary falls on the 16th (which
was the date when I made the post) or on the 17th (which is when most people
first saw it)... but really, what's the difference? We can celebrate on both
days as far as I'm concerned. Thanks for sticking with the project all these
years. Glad I was able to help. :)
Here's a link to the 1.00 announcement:

  Revert to the previous working version of lvm2. Based on the comments
  in the release notes for version 2.02.178, perhaps it would be prudent
  to sit out the next year and a half of planned instability. I can't
  recall ever _needing_ to upgrade LVM (the version number has been on
  2.02.x for well over a decade)... let's avoid being beta testers as
  upstream refactors everything.

testing/packages/pkgtools-15.0-noarch-20.txz:  Rebuilt.
  This update is a bit scarier than usual, so we're going to test it here
  first and then move it into the main tree in a couple of days if there
  are no serious bug reports. It's well-tested here, and works with the
  slackpkg that's in -current now, but I don't know about slackpkg+ so that's
  another reason to let it cool down here first. The purpose of this update
  is to migrate the package database and directories from /var/log to
  /var/lib/pkgtools. /var/log was never a good place for this data, as it is
  considered by many to be a directory that could be wiped to free up some
  space. Originally the package database was in /var/adm, but the FSSTND
  (later FHS) group decided that directory should be a symlink to /var/log,
  and I went along with that since it was years ago and I was a n00b and didn't
  know any better. /var/lib/pkgtools will be a better and safer location.
  The removed_packages and removed_scripts directories are really just logs
  that aren't actually used for anything - those will remain under /var/log,
  but moved into /var/log/pkgtools. Everything under /var/log will be
  considered potentially non-permanent by the pkgtools - if any directories or
  symlinks disappear from there, the pkgtools will automatically recreate them
  as needed. In fact, the migration process will create symlinks from all the
  old directory locations to the new ones, so anything that expects the old
  locations (including slackpkg, for now) should continue to work. Once this
  moves into the main tree, the plan is to fix other packages to use the new
  installer script directory (/var/lib/pkgtools/setup) and change the installer
  and slackpkg to use the new native locations for everything. When slackpkg
  is changed over to use the new native locations, I'll also make sure to float
  that in testing/ for a few days before moving it to the main tree to avoid
  more unintentional disruption to slackpkg+ users.
  Be aware that the package database migration is a one-way operation, but even
  so if you later downgrade to an older version of the pkgtools it will still
  work through the compatibility symlinks.

  Allow using vimdiff to compare .new and original files
  Numerous fixups for alternate $ROOT
  .new config files are sorted so that display order should be consistent
  among multiple machines
  Abort operation if system date is near epoch (mostly relevant for ARM
  machines and others with no RTC)
  Update Slackware ARM gpg key
  Update Slackware ARM mirror list
  No longer offer to run lilo - simply advise user that the kernel image has
  changed and give advice, but also require a keypress to (hopefully) confirm
  that the message was actually read
  mandoc lint fixes to slackpkg.8
  Warn user if a -current mirror is selected (but only warn once)
d/git-2.17.1-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes security issues:
  Submodule "names" come from the untrusted .gitmodules file, but we
  blindly append them to $GIT_DIR/modules to create our on-disk repo
  paths. This means you can do bad things by putting "../" into the
  name. We now enforce some rules for submodule names which will cause
  Git to ignore these malicious names (CVE-2018-11235).
  Credit for finding this vulnerability and the proof of concept from
  which the test script was adapted goes to Etienne Stalmans.
  It was possible to trick the code that sanity-checks paths on NTFS
  into reading random piece of memory (CVE-2018-11233).
  Credit for fixing for these bugs goes to Jeff King, Johannes
  Schindelin and others.

Where possible, the driver packages for X11 have been recompiled. However,
there were some (xf86-video-geode, xf86-video-tseng, xf86-video-sis,
xf86-video-savage, xf86-video-s3virge, xf86-video-rendition, xf86-video-r128,
and xf86-video-mach64) that would not compile against xorg-server-1.20.0 and
for which no patches seem to be available. Is anyone still using those, or are
they finally obsolete? I'll hold off on removing them until I can find out one
way or the other.

n/openssl-1.1.0h-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  Shared library .so-version bump.
n/openssl10-1.0.2o-x86_64-1.txz:  Added.
  Added a compatibility development package for sources that need to be
  compiled against openssl-1.0.2o. To compile against openssl-1.0.2o, you'll
  need to add lines like this to the build script:
    export CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -I/usr/include/openssl-1.0"
    export LIBS="-L/usr/lib${LIBDIRSUFFIX}/openssl-1.0"
  Some sources may still make a mess of things, and in those cases it might be
  easiest to temporarily remove the openssl (1.1.0h) package while compiling,
  in addition to the changes shown above.
  The shared libraries in this package (and also duplicated in the
  openssl10-solibs package) have also been changed to use versioned symbols.
  Old binaries and libraries will continue to run linked with these new
  libraries, but it is suggested to recompile them if possible. This will
  prevent problems in case something ends up linking both the 1.0.2 and the
  1.1.0 OpenSSL libraries.

Don't like PulseAudio? Well... I hear you. Personally, it works for me, and it
makes it easier to switch between multiple audio inputs and outputs compared
to using plain ALSA. PulseAudio got off to a rocky start in the Linux world,
where it found itself adopted before it was ready (it was even billed on its
own website at the time as "the software that currently breaks your audio").
It's my opinion that the reputation that PulseAudio acquired due to problems
back then isn't deserved any longer. If your hardware supports the sampling
rate of the audio data you're trying to play, PulseAudio will not resample it
(and if your hardware doesn't support that rate, resampling can hardly be
avoided). The increased latency has not been an issue here. Nevertheless, I
recognize that there are use cases where PulseAudio is still a detriment.
While I don't generally recommend removing PulseAudio, I'm not going to cram
it down your throat. So, if you'd like to be rid of PulseAudio, head over to
the new extra/pure-alsa-system directory and follow the instructions in the
README file there, and you'll have a PulseAudio-free pure ALSA system.
Thanks to orbea who sent me a small patch for the mpg123.SlackBuild so that
it would detect the lack of PulseAudio and not try to build in support, which
got me to thinking about all of this. Cheers! :-)

Hi folks, and welcome to the third ever Slackware Mass Rebuild (and the
longest ChangeLog entry in project history). There were two primary
motivations for rebuilding everything in the main tree. The first was to
switch to the new C++ ABI. The second was to get rid of all the .la files
in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Really, having .la files installed has been mostly
obsolete since things began to use pkg-config instead, but it's not easy
to get rid of them unless you do it all at once. If you just take them out
of one package, any other packages containing .la files that refer to the
removed ones will be broken. We've removed a few here and there before
(and then handled any packages that had referred to them with a rebuild),
but it was time to finally remove all the ones in /lib{,64} and
/usr/lib{,64}. One of the reasons that this really needed to happen is that
many projects are starting to migrate to build systems other than autotools,
and those systems do not generate .la files. So if we didn't get rid of them
now, we might end up in a situation later on where they are being removed
by upstream and then we would have to chase down the dependency breakage and
recompile (possibly many) other packages. The .la files that are outside of
the LD_LIBRARY_PATH were not removed (and shouldn't be) - those ones are
often used by the lt_dlopen() function to load plugins and removing those
ones can break things. But those ones don't cause problems... they aren't
likely to try to infect .la files produced by other packages.
IMPORTANT NOTE: If you have any third party or other packages installed on
your system that don't come with Slackware, and those packages have installed
any .la files, it is very likely that they refer to some .la files which we
have just removed, and that trying to compile against these packages will no
longer work. Luckily, the solution is simple: remove them. This command will
remove any stale .la files from the LD_LIBRARY_PATH:
rm /{,usr/}lib{,64}/*.la
Moving forward, nothing shipped in Slackware will contain any .la files in
those directories, and any SlackBuilds intended to be used with Slackware 15.0
should contain this bit of script:
# Don't ship .la files:
rm -f $PKG/{,usr/}lib${LIBDIRSUFFIX}/*.la
In addition to those goals, the opportunity was taken to clean up slack-desc
files and make many trivial fixes to build scripts. We've also made it easy
to recompile everything again should there be a good reason to do so.
You'll also find various updates scattered throughout this long list.
Enjoy, and sorry about the bandwidth. ;-)

  Change the xterm entry in xterm.terminfo (way down at the bottom, where it
  says "customization begins here" and that we may need to change the xterm
  entry since it is used "for a variety of incompatible terminal emulations")
  to drop the use of use=rep+ansi. In addition to causing Konsole breakage, I
  have verification that rep= was causing problems with terminals connecting
  from OSX. Only the xterm entry has changed. Previously this was an alias for
  xterm-new, which has not been altered. Feel free to use xterm-new instead if
  it suits your needs better.

  The patch to restore tcp_wrappers no longer works (applies, but breaks
  incoming connections), so tcp_wrappers is no longer supported. This support
  was dropped by upstream years ago, and there are many better ways to filter
  incoming ports since the days when tcp_wrappers was the only choice.
  There is very little chance that we will try to add support for tcp_wrappers
  again here. Migrate to a better port filtering solution (e.g., iptables or
  nftables), or (I suppose) you could try asking for the support to be
  reinstated upstream. ;-)

  This is a security update in order to patch the following defects:
    On a Samba 4 AD DC the LDAP server in all versions of Samba from
  4.0.0 onwards incorrectly validates permissions to modify passwords
  over LDAP allowing authenticated users to change any other users`
  passwords, including administrative users.
    All versions of Samba from 4.0.0 onwards are vulnerable to a denial of
  service attack when the RPC spoolss service is configured to be run as
  an external daemon. Missing input sanitization checks on some of the
  input parameters to spoolss RPC calls could cause the print spooler
  service to crash. There is no known vulnerability associated with this
  error, merely a denial of service. If the RPC spoolss service is left by
  default as an internal service, all a client can do is crash its own
  authenticated connection.

  Let the library stay in /usr/lib{,64}. There's not much point in moving it
  since plzip will require libstdc++.so in /usr/lib{,64}, and we're not going
  to move that one. And realistically, there's also not much point in worrying
  about whether the package tools will work with /usr unavailable.
a/pkgtools-15.0-noarch-4.txz:  Rebuilt.

  installpkg: support multiple threads for xz. Thanks to ivandi.
  Default threads for plzip is now equal to the number of CPU threads on
  the system rather than the number of physical cores. Default number of
  threads on xz is set to 2, to avoid a memory allocation problem when
  using too many threads on 32-bit. Not that it matters... they still
  haven't implemented multi-threaded xz decompression.
  makepkg: refactored setting compression type by requested extension.

  Change .tlz to mean .tar.lz. We never really used the previous definition
  (which was tar.lzma), and .lz is a probably a better format than xz or lzma.
  Reference:  https://www.nongnu.org/lzip/xz_inadequate.html
  For xz/lzip based packages, support multithreaded compression/decompression.
  Thanks to Erik Jan Tromp for assistance and advice with testing the changes
  for lzip and thread support, as well for as getting a bug in lzlib/plzip
  fixed upstream.
  Support extended attributes and POSIX ACLs in packages.

  This update fixes a security issue:
  Net::FTP#get, getbinaryfile, gettextfile, put, putbinaryfile, and puttextfile
  use Kernel#open to open a local file. If the localfile argument starts with
  the pipe character "|", the command following the pipe character is executed.
  The default value of localfile is File.basename(remotefile), so malicious FTP
  servers could cause arbitrary command execution.

  These sources have been patched with two patches that have been submitted
  upstream but have yet to appear in the mainline or stable kernels. With the
  patches applied this kernel seems stable now on both 32 and 64-bit x86.
  Thanks to Michele Ballabio for reporting the issue to the upstream kernel
  developers, and to Ming Lei for the fix. Once these patches appear in the
  4.14.x kernel series (and barring any other major regressions), we'll be
  moving these kernels back into the main tree.

We're moving back to the 4.9.x kernel series in the main tree until we can
figure out a fix for unstable 4.14.x kernels (especially on 32-bit). Guessing
it's probably going to be fixable with .config changes, since a greatly
simplified .config is stable. Meanwhile, the latest 4.14.x kernels can now be
found in the testing/ directory.

  Fix heap overflows when parsing malicious files. (CVE-2017-16612)
  It is possible to trigger heap overflows due to an integer overflow
  while parsing images and a signedness issue while parsing comments.
  The integer overflow occurs because the chosen limit 0x10000 for
  dimensions is too large for 32 bit systems, because each pixel takes
  4 bytes. Properly chosen values allow an overflow which in turn will
  lead to less allocated memory than needed for subsequent reads.
  The signedness bug is triggered by reading the length of a comment
  as unsigned int, but casting it to int when calling the function
  XcursorCommentCreate. Turning length into a negative value allows the
  check against XCURSOR_COMMENT_MAX_LEN to pass, and the following
  addition of sizeof (XcursorComment) + 1 makes it possible to allocate
  less memory than needed for subsequent reads.

  Open files with O_NOFOLLOW. (CVE-2017-16611)
  A non-privileged X client can instruct X server running under root
  to open any file by creating own directory with "fonts.dir",
  "fonts.alias" or any font file being a symbolic link to any other
  file in the system. X server will then open it. This can be issue
  with special files such as /dev/watchdog (which could then reboot
  the system).

  This is a security release in order to address the following defects:
  CVE-2017-14746 (Use-after-free vulnerability.)
    All versions of Samba from 4.0.0 onwards are vulnerable to a use after
    free vulnerability, where a malicious SMB1 request can be used to
    control the contents of heap memory via a deallocated heap pointer. It
    is possible this may be used to compromise the SMB server.
  CVE-2017-15275 (Server heap memory information leak.)
    All versions of Samba from 3.6.0 onwards are vulnerable to a heap
    memory information leak, where server allocated heap memory may be
    returned to the client without being cleared.

n/openssl-1.0.2m-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes a security issue:
  There is a carry propagating bug in the x64 Montgomery squaring procedure.
  No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA
  and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and
  are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible
  (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce
  information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of
  resources required for such an attack would be very significant and likely
  only accessible to a limited number of attackers. An attacker would
  additionally need online access to an unpatched system using the target
  private key in a scenario with persistent DH parameters and a private
  key that is shared between multiple clients.
  This only affects processors that support the BMI1, BMI2 and ADX extensions
  like Intel Broadwell (5th generation) and later or AMD Ryzen.

  Generating strings for XKB data used a single shared static buffer,
  which offered several opportunities for errors. Use a ring of
  resizable buffers instead, to avoid problems when strings end up
  longer than anticipated.

n/samba-4.6.8-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This is a security release in order to address the following defects:
  SMB1/2/3 connections may not require signing where they should. A man in the
  middle attack may hijack client connections.
  SMB3 connections don't keep encryption across DFS redirects. A man in the
  middle attack can read and may alter confidential documents transferred via
  a client connection, which are reached via DFS redirect when the original
  connection used SMB3.
  Server memory information leak over SMB1. Client with write access to a share
  can cause server memory contents to be written into a file or printer.

  This update fixes two security issues:
  A user authenticated to an X Session could crash or execute code in the
  context of the X Server by exploiting a stack overflow in the endianness
  conversion of X Events.
  Uninitialized data in endianness conversion in the XEvent handling of the
  X.Org X Server allowed authenticated malicious users to access potentially
  privileged data from the X server.

  Fixes security issues:
  A "ssh://..." URL can result in a "ssh" command line with a hostname that
  begins with a dash "-", which would cause the "ssh" command to instead
  (mis)treat it as an option. This is now prevented by forbidding such a
  hostname (which should not impact any real-world usage).
  Similarly, when GIT_PROXY_COMMAND is configured, the command is run with
  host and port that are parsed out from "ssh://..." URL; a poorly written
  GIT_PROXY_COMMAND could be tricked into treating a string that begins with a
  dash "-" as an option. This is now prevented by forbidding such a hostname
  and port number (again, which should not impact any real-world usage).

d/mercurial-4.3.1-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  Fixes security issues:
  Mercurial's symlink auditing was incomplete prior to 4.3, and could
  be abused to write to files outside the repository.
  Mercurial was not sanitizing hostnames passed to ssh, allowing
  shell injection attacks on clients by specifying a hostname starting
  with -oProxyCommand.

  This update fixes an authentication validation bypass security issue:
  "Orpheus' Lyre mutual authentication validation bypass"
  All versions of Samba from 4.0.0 onwards using embedded Heimdal
  Kerberos are vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack impersonating
  a trusted server, who may gain elevated access to the domain by
  returning malicious replication or authorization data.
  Samba binaries built against MIT Kerberos are not vulnerable.

  This kernel fixes two "Stack Clash" vulnerabilities reported by Qualys.
  The first issue may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code with elevated
  privileges. Failed attack attempts will likely result in denial-of-service
  conditions. The second issue can be exploited to bypass certain security
  restrictions and perform unauthorized actions.

  First, NTP drops privileges and runs as ntp:ntp. Be sure to install the
  updated etc package to get the new user and group.
  Some files have been relocated:
  The ntp.keys file has moved from /etc/ntp/ to /etc/.
  The drift and stats files now reside in /var/lib/ntp/.
  The step-tickers file has been removed. It's actually been deprecated for
  a while and nothing has referenced in for quite some time.
  Be sure to move the new rc.ntpd.new into place, and move over or merge
  from the .new config files.
  Thanks to Robby Workman for help with these changes.

  issues of medium and low severity:
  Denial of Service via Malformed Config (Medium)

  Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with
  logon to compromise the server.  Successful attacks of this vulnerability
  can result in unauthorized access to data.

  thereby making privilege separation mandatory.  Note that privilege
  separation has been on by default for almost 15 years and sandboxing
  has been on by default for almost the last five, so this shouldn't
  change anything for most users.

  This update fixes a security issue:
  An incorrect implementation of XEP-0280: Message Carbons in multiple XMPP
  clients allows a remote attacker to impersonate any user, including
  contacts, in the vulnerable application's display.  This allows for various
  kinds of social engineering attacks.

a/mlocate-0.26-x86_64-1.txz:  Added.
  This replaces slocate as the system locate/updatedb utilities.
  In tests here, mlocate was about 20% faster than slocate at creating a
  new database.  When updating an existing database, it was many times
  faster.  On my machine, the nightly database update took about 5 minutes
  with slocate, but only a few seconds with mlocate.
  I might miss (slightly) the heavy drive activity at 04:40 that would let
  me know that it was time for bed.  ;-)
  Be sure to move the new /etc/updatedb.conf into place when installing
  this package.

  This had been a required dep for PulseAudio, but has become optional.  Since
  being added to Slackware, a few other packages had begun to use it
  (NetworkManager, BIND), but it's not really critical there either so we're
  removing it from the main tree.  If you require json-c for something, it is
  expected that SBo will be picking it up.

  This update fixes a denial-of-service vulnerability.  Under some conditions
  when using both DNS64 and RPZ to rewrite query responses, query processing
  can resume in an inconsistent state leading to either an INSIST assertion
  failure or an attempt to read through a NULL pointer.

  This update fixes a denial-of-service vulnerability.  An error in handling
  certain queries can cause an assertion failure when a server is using the
  nxdomain-redirect feature to cover a zone for which it is also providing
  authoritative service.  A vulnerable server could be intentionally stopped
  by an attacker if it was using a configuration that met the criteria for
  the vulnerability and if the attacker could cause it to accept a query
  that possessed the required attributes.
  Please note: This vulnerability affects the "nxdomain-redirect" feature,
  which is one of two methods of handling NXDOMAIN redirection, and is only
  available in certain versions of BIND.  Redirection using zones of type
  "redirect" is not affected by this vulnerability.

  This release fixes an old NULL pointer dereference bug in png_set_text_2()
  discovered and patched by Patrick Keshishian.  The potential "NULL
  dereference" bug has existed in libpng since version 0.71 of June 26, 1995.
  To be vulnerable, an application has to load a text chunk into the png
  structure, then delete all text, then add another text chunk to the same
  png structure, which seems to be an unlikely sequence, but it has happened.

  This is primarily a bugfix release, and also addresses security issues.
  ssh-agent(1): Will now refuse to load PKCS#11 modules from paths outside
    a trusted whitelist.
  sshd(8): When privilege separation is disabled, forwarded Unix-domain
    sockets would be created by sshd(8) with the privileges of 'root'.
  sshd(8): Avoid theoretical leak of host private key material to
    privilege-separated child processes via realloc().
  sshd(8): The shared memory manager used by pre-authentication compression
    support had a bounds checks that could be elided by some optimising
    compilers to potentially allow attacks against the privileged monitor.
    process from the sandboxed privilege-separation process.
  sshd(8): Validate address ranges for AllowUser and DenyUsers directives at
    configuration load time and refuse to accept invalid ones.  It was
    previously possible to specify invalid CIDR address ranges
    (e.g. user@127.1.2.3/55) and these would always match, possibly resulting
    in granting access where it was not intended.

  This kernel fixes a security issue with a race condition in
  net/packet/af_packet.c that can be exploited to gain kernel code execution
  from unprivileged processes.
  Thanks to Philip Pettersson for discovering the bug and providing a patch.
  Be sure to upgrade your initrd after upgrading the kernel packages.
  If you use lilo to boot your machine, be sure lilo.conf points to the correct
  kernel and initrd and run lilo as root to update the bootloader.
  If you use elilo to boot your machine, you should run eliloconfig to copy the
  kernel and initrd to the EFI System Partition.

  This update fixes a denial-of-service vulnerability.  A defect in BIND's
  handling of responses containing a DNAME answer can cause a resolver to exit
  after encountering an assertion failure in db.c or resolver.c.  A server
  encountering either of these error conditions will stop, resulting in denial
  of service to clients.  The risk to authoritative servers is minimal;
  recursive servers are chiefly at risk.

  This kernel fixes a security issue known as "Dirty COW".  A race
  condition was found in the way the Linux kernel's memory subsystem
  handled the copy-on-write (COW) breakage of private read-only
  memory mappings.  An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to
  gain write access to otherwise read-only memory mappings and thus
  increase their privileges on the system.

  A flaw was found in the implementation of the Linux kernels handling of
  networking challenge ack where an attacker is able to determine the shared

  or take over a TCP connection between a server and client without having to
  be a traditional Man In the Middle (MITM) style attack.

  sshd(8): Mitigate a potential denial-of-service attack against the system's
  crypt(3) function via sshd(8).
  sshd(8): Mitigate timing differences in password authentication that could
  be used to discern valid from invalid account names when long passwords were
  sent and particular password hashing algorithms are in use on the server.
  ssh(1), sshd(8): Fix observable timing weakness in the CBC padding oracle
  countermeasures. 
  ssh(1), sshd(8): Improve operation ordering of MAC verification for
  Encrypt-then-MAC (EtM) mode transport MAC algorithms to verify the MAC
  before decrypting any ciphertext.

  Changes to pkgtool:
  Remove option to install from floppy disks.
  Don't use the --file option, which appears to be broken in the latest version
  of dialog.  The only reason --file was ever used in the first place was to
  work around the Linux ARG_MAX limit of 131072 bytes, and since Linux 2.6.23 a
  much larger limit is in place making it unlikely to become an issue again.
  So we'll go back to passing the package list on the command line.

  This release fixes a security issue:
  Client side SMB2/3 required signing can be downgraded.
  It's possible for an attacker to downgrade the required signing for an
  SMB2/3 client connection, by injecting the SMB2_SESSION_FLAG_IS_GUEST or
  SMB2_SESSION_FLAG_IS_NULL flags.  This means that the attacker can
  impersonate a server being connected to by Samba, and return malicious
  results.

Slackware 14.2 x86_64 stable is released!

The long development cycle (the Linux community has lately been living in
"interesting times", as they say) is finally behind us, and we're proud to
announce the release of Slackware 14.2.  The new release brings many updates
and modern tools, has switched from udev to eudev (no systemd), and adds
well over a hundred new packages to the system.  Thanks to the team, the
upstream developers, the dedicated Slackware community, and everyone else
who pitched in to help make this release a reality.

The ISOs are off to be replicated, a 6 CD-ROM 32-bit set and a dual-sided
32-bit/64-bit x86/x86_64 DVD.  Please consider supporting the Slackware
project by picking up a copy from store.slackware.com.  We're taking
pre-orders now, and offer a discount if you sign up for a subscription.

Have fun!  :-)
