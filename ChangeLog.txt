Slackware 14.0 x86_64 stable is released!

We're perfectionists here at Slackware, so this release has been a long
time a-brewing.  But we think you'll agree that it was worth the wait.
Slackware 14.0 combines modern components, ease of use, and flexible
configuration... our "KISS" philosophy demands it.

The ISOs are off to be replicated, a 6 CD-ROM 32-bit set and a dual-sided
32-bit/64-bit x86/x86_64 DVD.  Please consider supporting the Slackware
project by picking up a copy from store.slackware.com.  We're taking
pre-orders now, and offer a discount if you sign up for a subscription.

Thanks to everyone who helped make this happen.  The Slackware team, the
upstream developers, and (of course) the awesome Slackware user community.

Have fun!  :-)

a/sysvinit-scripts-2.0-noarch-13.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Changed the path in rc.M for wicd from relative to absolute.  It works
  either way, but it should be an absolute path just to be consistent with
  the rest of the script.

Here are a few minor bugfixes as well as a couple more test drivers for X:
a/e2fsprogs-1.42.6-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This is a bugfix release.
a/sysvinit-scripts-2.0-noarch-12.txz:  Rebuilt.
  In rc.M, don't run rc.wicd if /usr/sbin/wicd does not exist.  This change
  prevents a leftover rc.wicd from blocking NetworkManager startup.
l/gamin-0.1.10-x86_64-5.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Patched to fix a deadlock bug, and to fix building against recent libraries.
  Thanks to sberthelot, sombragris, and ponce on LQ.
l/mozilla-nss-3.13.5-x86_64-3.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Added libcrmf.a to the package, needed to compile xulrunner.
  Thanks to Robby Workman.
isolinux/initrd.img:  Rebuilt.
  Upgraded to e2fsprogs-1.42.6.
testing/packages/xf86-video-intel-2.20.8-x86_64-1.txz:  Added.
  This driver requires the libdrm in /testing.
testing/packages/xf86-video-ati-6.14.6-x86_64-1.txz:  Added.
  This driver requires the libdrm in /testing.
testing/source/config-testing-3.*:  Rebuilt.
  Changed CONFIG_GFS2_FS in huge kernels from y -> m to fix the compile.
usb-and-pxe-installers/usbboot.img:  Rebuilt.
  Upgraded to e2fsprogs-1.42.6.
+--------------------------+

I'll go along with the last minute request to provide the released stable
version of xf86-video-nouveau.  The reason that we hadn't done this is that
the stable version of Mesa won't compile with this version of libdrm.  But,
since xf86-video-nouveau compiles fine with this libdrm and the Mesa we're
already shipping, it seems reasonable to provide them here in /testing.
Thanks to Didier Spaier.
testing/packages/libdrm-2.4.39-x86_64-1.txz:  Added.
testing/packages/xf86-video-nouveau-1.0.2-x86_64-1.txz:  Added.

Here we go one more time with Slackware 14.0 release candidate 5.
Really, this time it is not a drill!  Everything is in place and
ready to release at this point, and unless there's some kind of
showstopper found (which doesn't seem too likely after all the
testing that's happened), the release can be expected soon.
After careful consideration and a considerable amount of internal
testing I did relent to give the kernel one more bump to 3.2.29,
so of course 3.2.30 was released a couple of hours ago.  ;-)
But that's not a showstopper, and it seems to be time to get off
the never-ending kernel upgrade treadmill until the next cycle
begins.  Speaking of kernels, I added sample .configs for all the
3.x kernel branches in /testing.  So test away, and if there are
any new problems (or old ones that we missed), let us know soon!
a/glibc-solibs-2.15-x86_64-7.txz:  Rebuilt.

  Thanks to Martin.
isolinux/initrd.img:  Rebuilt.
  Upgraded to Linux kernel 3.2.29.
kernels/*:  Upgraded.

Fri Sep 14 20:29:40 UTC 2012
n/dhcp-4.2.4_P2-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  An issue with the use of lease times was found and fixed.  Making certain
  changes to the end time of an IPv6 lease could cause the server to abort.
  Thanks to Glen Eustace of Massey University, New Zealand for finding this
  issue.  [ISC-Bugs #30281]
  For more information, see:
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-3955
  (* Security fix *)
n/php-5.4.7-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This is a bugfix release.
+--------------------------+
Fri Sep 14 01:16:31 UTC 2012
a/less-451-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This is a bugfix release.  (Seems more or less safe  ;-)
a/patch-2.7-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This version of patch ignores destination filenames that are absolute or
  that contain a component of "..", unless such a filename is provided as
  an argument.
  For more information, see:
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-4651
  (* Security fix *)
a/shadow-4.1.4.3-x86_64-7.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Fixed adduser and login.defs to add or suggest group "scanner", which
  might still be required by third party scanner drivers.
  Thanks to Alex Baer.
a/sysvinit-scripts-2.0-noarch-11.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Edited rc.S to talk about the 3.x kernel in the udev comments.
  Edited rc.M to run rc.udev in all cases again, not just when returning
  from runlevel 1.  Even if udev is running already, the additional
  trigger may be required in order to get some devices working.  The
  comment that indicated it should only be run when returning from
  runlevel 1 came from a time when the only purpose for rc.udev was to
  start it if it wasn't running.  The behavior has changed since then, so
  the comment has been fixed.  Guess I should have remembered the words of:
    fortune -m Storer
l/libsoup-2.38.1-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Added the .la files back, as it's not yet safe to eliminate them in this
  package.  Thanks to Erik Hanson.
n/bind-9.9.1_P3-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes a security issue where named could crash on a specially
  crafted record.  [RT #30416]
  (* Security fix *)
+--------------------------+
Wed Sep 12 06:04:55 UTC 2012
n/netatalk-2.2.3-x86_64-4.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Fix the install script so that it leaves rc.atalk.new when the package is
  upgraded instead of deleting it and leaving nothing but the old rc.atalk.
  Thanks to Sorin Mitrica.
+--------------------------+
Wed Sep 12 02:45:31 UTC 2012
a/sysvinit-scripts-2.0-noarch-10.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Use start parameter when running /etc/rc.d/rc.atalk.
n/ca-certificates-20120623-noarch-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Use an installer script to make sure that update-ca-certificates works on
  a fresh installation.  Thanks to DarkVision on LQ.
n/netatalk-2.2.3-x86_64-3.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Switched to a better rc.atalk that parses the contents of netatalk.conf.
  Thanks to gerasimos_h.
+--------------------------+
Mon Sep 10 22:19:55 UTC 2012
a/sysvinit-scripts-2.0-noarch-9.txz:  Rebuilt.
  In rc.M, make sure we are actually returning from runlevel 1 before trying
  to restart udev.  Thanks to Cal Peake.
a/udev-182-x86_64-5.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Don't enable autosuspend for some HID devices.  With a 3.5+ kernel, this
  might cause these input devices to become non-responsive.
  Thanks to Patrick Verner.
ap/alsa-utils-1.0.26-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  Removed alsaconf, which does not work with kmod.
l/alsa-lib-1.0.26-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.

  Patched update-gdk-pixbuf-loaders to fix output on multilib systems.
  Thanks to Cal Peake.
l/seamonkey-solibs-2.12.1-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This is a bugfix release.
x/scim-1.4.14-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Compile using --with-gtk-version=2 to fix problems with scim-setup.
  Thanks to Thomas Choi and alienBOB.
xap/seamonkey-2.12.1-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This is a bugfix release.
+--------------------------+
Mon Sep 10 02:55:29 UTC 2012
ap/hplip-3.12.9-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes some known scanning bugs.
  Thanks to Ken Zalewski.
ap/mc-4.8.4-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Patched file save problem caused by a missing '/' in the tmp directory path.
  Thanks to guanx on LQ.
n/bluez-4.99-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Enable the audio socket in audio.conf.
  Thanks to guanx on LQ.
xap/mozilla-thunderbird-15.0.1-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This is a bugfix release.
xap/xine-ui-0.99.6-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  Willy Sudiarto Raharjo claims this one is better than 0.99.5, so I guess we
  will see (quickly).  After this, I'm going to be far more resistant to any
  attempts to try to resume the devel cycle.  ;-)
+--------------------------+
Sun Sep  9 03:00:36 UTC 2012
xap/xine-ui-0.99.5-x86_64-3.txz:  Reverted.
  The file open shortcut appears to be broken in the newer xine-ui.  Probably
  safer to just revert it at this point.  The new xine-lib seems OK, though.
+--------------------------+
Sat Sep  8 20:04:10 UTC 2012
ap/mc-4.8.4-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  The stable verson of mc has several known, annoying bugs.  They are fixed in
  this version...  hopefully without too many new ones.
xap/xine-lib-1.1.21-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This is a bugfix release, and had flown under the radar here due to previous
  1.2.x releases.  I've tested it and it at least works as well as the package
  it replaces.  With phonon-xine deprecated, I'm not sure how long Xine will
  be included in Slackware, but this update doesn't seem to hurt so we'll take
  it.  Thanks to Willy Sudiarto Raharjo.
xap/xine-ui-0.99.7-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This is a bugfix release.  Thanks to Willy Sudiarto Raharjo.
+--------------------------+
Fri Sep  7 20:27:46 UTC 2012
a/dcron-4.5-x86_64-4.txz:  Rebuilt.
  After following the discussion about it on LQ, it seems better to not
  direct script output in run-parts to /dev/null, since the default crontab
  does that already.  That way if someone wants to get cron job output
  mailed to them it's easy to do by editing the crontab.  Thanks to NoStressHQ.
a/sysvinit-scripts-2.0-noarch-8.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Updated rescan-scsi-bus and patched around a test that fails.
  Thanks to slacktroll on LQ.
xap/mozilla-firefox-15.0.1-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This is a bugfix release.
isolinux/initrd.img:  Rebuilt.
  Updated /sbin/rescan-scsi-bus.
usb-and-pxe-installers/usbboot.img:  Rebuilt.
  Updated /sbin/rescan-scsi-bus.
+--------------------------+
Thu Sep  6 21:58:57 UTC 2012
a/dcron-4.5-x86_64-3.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Fixed run-parts to only output stderr, so that cron will only send mail
  in the event that a script runs into errors.
  Thanks to Barcoboy on LQ.
a/sysvinit-scripts-2.0-noarch-7.txz:  Rebuilt.
  In rc.S, don't run cryptsetup three times in a loop, since it will already
  allow three password attempts by default.
  Thanks to Michael L. Semon.
+--------------------------+
Tue Sep  4 21:54:46 UTC 2012
A few more adjustments, but probably not enough to merit calling this a
new RC release.  Pretty close now, but please report any bugs!
a/aaa_elflibs-14.0-x86_64-4.txz:  Rebuilt.
a/coreutils-8.19-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  Upgraded for some important bugfixes, including possible data loss in
  "sort" output.
a/eject-2.1.5-x86_64-3.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Fixed "eject -T".  Thanks to Darrell Anderson.
a/etc-14.0-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  Fixed root $path in /etc/csh.login.new.
  Thanks to Goran Lazic.
a/grep-2.14-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  Upgraded for some important bugfixes.  This fixes a matching bug when
  using a multibyte locale, and merges a more refined patch from upstream
  for the false detection of small text files as binary on certain
  filesystems (including Btrfs).
a/mkinitrd-1.4.7-x86_64-6.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Fixed sed substitution for README.initrd.
  Thanks to D1ver on LQ.

n/netatalk-2.2.3-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Handle atalkd.conf.new and papd.conf.new in doinst.sh.
  Thanks to elyk on LQ.

e/emacs-24.2-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
+--------------------------+
Thu Aug 30 23:35:53 UTC 2012
Well, we fixed a lot of bugs and took some upgrades that we pretty much
needed to take since they were important bug and/or security fixes, so
it looks like we'll need to have a 14.0 release candidate 4 and another
(last?) round of testing.  Hopefully the fourth time is the charm!
a/cpio-2.11-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Fix CRC evaluation.
  Thanks to appzer0 and Nekrodes.
a/dbus-1.4.20-x86_64-3.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Patched to set HOME properly to avoid a /.config directory.  The fix is
  a little ugly, but seems harmless enough (and is less ugly than /.config).
a/glibc-solibs-2.15-x86_64-6.txz:  Rebuilt.
a/glibc-zoneinfo-2012e_2012e-noarch-6.txz:  Rebuilt.

d/git-1.7.12-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
l/glibc-2.15-x86_64-6.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Patched multiple integer overflows in the strtod, strtof, strtold, and
  strtod_l functions in stdlib in the GNU C Library allow local users to
  cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute
  arbitrary code via a long string, which triggers a stack-based buffer
  overflow.

  This might be needed in cases where X doesn't provide a driver for a
  video device, but the kernel supports a framebuffer for it.  It can't
  be in the main tree, though, because it breaks starting X without an
  xorg.conf.  Thanks to Jens Rottmann.

This is Slackware 14.0 release candidate 3, and is hopefully the last stop
on our long road to a stable Slackware release soon.  After hearing that
the 3.4.x kernel series will have long term support, I tested 3.4.9 hoping
that it would prove stable enough to use that as the release kernel, but
there are problems with an oops in kernel/time/clocksource.c every few boots.
Given that the 3.2.x series has been very stable, it seems prudent to stick
with that for release, and 3.2.28 is going to be the release kernel.  So,
one more round of testing.  Let me know if there are any problems.  Thanks!
a/aaa_base-14.0-x86_64-5.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Added /etc/os-release.
  Touched /etc/slackware-version to bring the datestamp closer to release.
a/btrfs-progs-20120821-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  There haven't been any changes in git since the last pull, but this
  package needed a rebuild anyway to get rid of the warnings in the
  slack-desc that are no longer applicable.
  Thanks to Jens Rottmann.

Getting close!  Hopefully we've cleared out most of the remaining issues
and are nearly ready here.  We'll call this release candidate 2.
Unless there's a very good rationale, versions are frozen.
Any reports of remaining bugs will be gladly taken, though.

  Thanks to Robby Workman.
e/emacs-24.1-x86_64-6.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Patched to fix a security flaw in the file-local variables code.
  When the Emacs user option `enable-local-variables' is set to `:safe'
  (the default value is t), Emacs should automatically refuse to evaluate
  `eval' forms in file-local variable sections.  Due to the bug, Emacs
  instead automatically evaluates such `eval' forms.  Thus, if the user
  changes the value of `enable-local-variables' to `:safe', visiting a
  malicious file can cause automatic execution of arbitrary Emacs Lisp
  code with the permissions of the user.  Bug discovered by Paul Ling.

  Thanks to Niki Kovacs.
  Switched to a new rc.yp script supporting start|stop|restart.
  If there's an existing script, it will be installed as a .new with the same
  permissions as the existing rc.yp, which had defaulted to executable since
  without editing it did nothing.  Unless you plan to use YP, be aware that
  moving the new script into place with 755 perms will cause a line of
  (harmless) noise telling you that YP has not configured yet.

Good hello, and happy Thursday!  Mercury went direct early yesterday morning,
and it was like the bugs started to fix themselves.  It's almost enough to get
me believing in that hocus-pocus nonsense!  So, here's a bunch of updates that
fix all of the reported issues in the beta, and we'll call this the 14.0
release candidate 1.  Still some updates needed for the top-level
documentation files, but we're clearly in the home stretch now (finally).
Test away, and report any remaining bugs!

l/boost-1.49.0-x86_64-3.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Linked against icu4c.  The built script was also upgraded to account for
  changes in the way boost is configured, and to only build the parts needed.
  Thanks to Heinz Wiesinger.
l/glib2-2.32.4-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
l/gnome-keyring-3.4.1-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.

l/gtk+3-3.4.4-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
l/polkit-0.105-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Added default policy files for udisks2 and NetworkManager events.  These
  along with GazL's xinitrc/startup script improvements seem to prevent
  ConsoleKit, PolicyKit, and D-Bus from being stupid most of the time.
  GazL's fix _should_ have been enough, but you know what they say about
  the difference between theory and practice.  :-)  The NetworkManager .pkla
  file seems to be needed anyway to allow users in the netdev group to
  modify network settings without being bothered to enter the root password.
  Thanks much to Chess Griffin.
l/qt-4.8.2-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Patched libQtWebKit.la and QtWebKit.pc to remove a false dependency on
  libwebcore.a, which is used internally at build time.

  Thanks to Darrell Anderson.
n/openssl-1.0.1c-x86_64-3.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Patched the certwatch script to quit warning about expired certificates
  in /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt.  The script was intended to warn
  when your personal certificates are about to expire, but it trips over
  this one that bundles the CA certs.  Thanks to ponce.
n/php-5.4.5-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Added support for intl module.
  Thanks to Heinz Wiesinger.
n/wireless-tools-29-x86_64-7.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Don't use the directory /sys/class/netdev_name/wireless/ directory to
  detect wireless cards in rc.wireless as it depends on
  CONFIG_WIRELESS_EXT_SYSFS=y in the kernel, which is deprecated and will
  be removed in future kernels.  Perhaps this was the cause of some of the
  reports of non-functional wireless interfaces?
  Thanks to Konrad Rzepecki.
x/x11-skel-7.7-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  In xwmconfig, write a $HOME/.xsession in addition to $HOME/.xinitrc,
  allowing users to choose a default window manager when using XDM.
  Thanks to GazL.

  Thanks to Robby Workman.
xap/blackbox-0.70.1-x86_64-7.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Created a new startup script "startblackbox" called from xinitrc.blackbox
  to allow running dbus-launch within ck-session-launch.  This fixes Thunar
  device mounting without breaking XDM.  Thanks much to GazL!
xap/fluxbox-1.3.2-x86_64-4.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Start dbus-launch in startfluxbox.  Thanks to GazL.
xap/fvwm-2.6.5-x86_64-4.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Created a new startup script "startfvwm2" called from xinitrc.fvwm2 to allow

a/gdisk-0.6.14-x86_64-1.txz:  Removed.
  The name of this package has been changed to "gptfdisk".
a/gptfdisk-0.8.5-x86_64-1.txz:  Added.
  This is the updated version of gdisk, which got a name change upstream.
  It has added two new programs: cgfdisk, which is a menu driven GPT fdisk
  similar to cfdisk, and fixparts, a tool for repairing corrupted GPT tables.
  Thanks to Robert Easter for the heads-up on this.

  Thanks to Franck Barbenoire.
x/xf86-video-nv-2.1.20-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This driver was supposedly deprecated a couple of years ago, but there's a
  new version out and so we'll upgrade since some people still use this simple
  non-KMS driver and there's been a report of a segfault with the previous
  version.  Thanks to Ken L.
xap/blackbox-0.70.1-x86_64-6.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Start dbus-launch within eval $() to prevent conflicts when XDM is used.
  However, this still does not allow users to mount with Thunar, or to make
  adjustments to nm-applet, and running polkit-gnome-authentication-agent-1
  didn't help.  Maybe it's not possible to get all this FDo/XDG fluff working
  with the minimalist WMs and I'm not sure most people using them will care
  all that much.  A greater proportion might be unhappy to see dbus and
  consolekit polluting the process table, to be honest.  Anyway, if someone
  has a solution that makes all this stuff work, I'm willing to take another
  look.  For now, at least, there's no conflict with XDM, and it's probably
  closer to actually working than it was before.
xap/fluxbox-1.3.2-x86_64-3.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Start dbus-launch within eval $() to prevent conflicts when XDM is used.
xap/fvwm-2.6.5-x86_64-3.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Start dbus-launch within eval $() to prevent conflicts when XDM is used.

a/dbus-1.4.20-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Patched rc.messagebus to restart the system D-Bus daemon even if a user
  daemon is running (as it does now with X11 sessions).
  Thanks to Darren Austin.
a/sysvinit-2.88dsf-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Fixed paths.h for /etc/forcefsck and /etc/fastboot.
  Thanks to Ken Milmore.
a/sysvinit-scripts-2.0-noarch-5.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Removed my convoluted /dev/root workaround in favor of a much more simple,
  elegant solution.  Thanks to Gary Langshaw.

  Recompiled --without-gsettings, which should fix runtime complaints.
  Thanks to GazL on LQ.
xap/xpdf-3.02pl6-x86_64-4.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Patched to fix slow scrolling caused by a quirk exposed in newer versions
  of gcc.  Patch by Michael Gilbert.  Thanks to LQ for pointing it out.
extra/google-chrome/google-chrome.SlackBuild:  Modified.
  Allow $ARCH to be preset before running the script.  This is useful for
  systems running a 32-bit userspace under a 64-bit kernel, perhaps in a
  chroot environment.  Thanks to Zhu Qun-Ying.
+--------------------------+
Mon Jul 30 20:42:03 UTC 2012
a/udev-182-x86_64-3.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Since many people blacklist aaa_base when upgrading with slackpkg, add a
  top-level /run directory to prevent problems.
l/gsettings-desktop-schemas-3.4.2-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Since this requires /usr/lib64 on x86_64, the package should not be built
  as "noarch".  Thanks to Eugene Wissner.
l/libdbusmenu-qt-0.9.2-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Relocate documentation.
n/curl-7.27.0-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.

  Use /bin/hostname from the git version of net-tools.
e/emacs-24.1-x86_64-4.txz:  Rebuilt.

n/bind-9.9.1_P2-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  Prevents a named assert (crash) when validating caused by using
  "Bad cache" data before it has been initialized.  [RT #30025]
  ISC_QUEUE handling for recursive clients was updated to address a
  race condition that could cause a memory leak.  This rarely occurred
  with UDP clients, but could be a significant problem for a server
  handling a steady rate of TCP queries.  [RT #29539 & #30233]
  Under heavy incoming TCP query loads named could experience a
  memory leak which could lead to significant reductions in query
  response or cause the server to be terminated on systems with
  "out of memory" killers. [RT #29539]
  A condition has been corrected where improper handling of zero-length
  RDATA could cause undesirable behavior, including termination of
  the named process.  [RT #29644]

  Get rid of broken /etc/skel/.xsession.  Thanks to GazL.
a/logrotate-3.8.1-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Fixed cron script to not log an error when there wasn't one.
  Thanks to NoStressHQ and GazL on LQ.
a/sysvinit-scripts-2.0-noarch-4.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Fixed rc.S to handle /dev/root properly in cases where /etc/fstab contains
  CIFS volumes (and lines start with //).  Thanks to John.
a/udev-182-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Add another sanity check to rc.udev to warn if CONFIG_DEVTMPFS and
  CONFIG_DEVTMPFS_MOUNT are not enabled in the kernel.
ap/zsh-5.0.0-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
e/emacs-24.1-x86_64-3.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Don't use GConf.
l/gvfs-1.12.3-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Don't restart D-Bus in the installation script.  It causes errors from
  the installer, and is no longer needed anyway since D-Bus notices
  changed configuration without a reload.
  Don't automount network volumes (causes a long startup delay in Thunar).
l/libpng-1.4.12-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  Fixed incorrect type (int copy should be png_size_t copy) in png_inflate()
  (fixes CVE-2011-3045).
  Revised png_set_text_2() to avoid potential memory corruption (fixes
    CVE-2011-3048).
  Changed "a+w" to "u+w" in Makefile.in to fix CVE-2012-3386.

xfce/xfwm4-4.10.0-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Modified xinitrc.xfce to handle system-wide .Xresources and .Xmodmap.
  Launch startxfce4 using ck-launch-session and/or dbus-launch to fix problems
  with using XDM.  This same approach should also help Thunar on other window
  managers.  Let me know if there are any issues, as I'll likely be applying
  these changes to the other xinitrc files.  Thanks to GazL on LQ.
extra/bash-completion/bash-completion-2.0-noarch-2.txz:  Rebuilt.

Howdy!  Lots of shiny stuff here, including the long awaited Xfce 4.10!
Thanks to Robby Workman for the initial set of build scripts, and lots
of testing (plus some very helpful notes about things such as the proper
build order).  I'm calling this a beta (finally!), and it's really very
close to what we expect to release.  Test away.
BTW, Mercury leaves retrograde on August 8th, position 01:26 Leo.  ;-)
a/aaa_elflibs-14.0-x86_64-3.txz:  Rebuilt.

  Show the date after setting the system clock.
  Thanks to Darrell Anderson.
  Shut down udev in rc.6.  Thanks to Robby Workman.
  In rc.S, determine the actual root partition and insert it into /etc/mtab
  so that "/dev/root" isn't shown when booting a kernel without an initrd.
  I should have fixed this years ago.
a/udev-182-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  Well, udev in this devel cycle has certainly been interesting!  A fair
  number of odd bug reports have been coming in, and we hadn't really been
  able to get a handle on the source of the issues.  Quite some time ago
  we started testing udev-182, and noticed that it caused some issues with
  the persistent net and cd rules.  There'd sometimes be two entries per
  device, so a machine with a single Ethernet card might come up showing the
  card as eth1, with two rules in 70-persistent-net.rules (eth0 and eth1).
  We tested a lot of udev versions trying to determine where the problem
  started, and it seemed to begin with version 176, the first one that
  used libkmod rather than calling out to module-init-tools to load modules.
  Asking upstream about it, they suggested that we just turn the generation
  of persistent rules off.  They'd already turned it off by default.  "Make
  'em make rules!" seemed to be the answer, and since I remember well why
  the autogeneration of net and CD rules came about, I wasn't really happy
  with that answer.  After deploying the "safe" upgrade to 175, we got a
  couple of reports of this same issue happening (though none of us could
  reproduce the issue with 175).  Robby ended up making some patches to
  the rule writing scripts for udev-182 that were able to stop the doubling
  up of rules, but the devices themselves would still be misnumbered on the
  first boot without rules, and would then be correct after a reboot.
    Last week I sat down determined to figure out where the race condition
  was.  After endless reboots with various tests, I got the idea to put my
  network modules on the initrd and have it shell out so that I could take
  a look at them.  What I found was that the rules were generated correctly
  on the initrd.  Well, that was a surprise, but I must have had some kind
  of hunch to even try a test like that.  On another hunch, I ran
  "pstree -c -p | grep udevd" on the running system.  Heh.  There it was.
  We had been running two copies of udevd, and they were fighting it out.
  At some point along the line, udevd was changed.  It used to be that if
  you tried to start a second copy it wouldn't start, and would exit with
  status 1, and our rc.udev script relied on this behavior.  Fixing the
  problem was considerably easier than finding it...  rworkman and I made
  some changes in rc.udev to check if udevd was already running instead
  of expecting it to check for itself.  Another change was required to
  cause it to write out rules if they didn't exist already, and then to
  read them back in (otherwise optical symlinks were still missing on first
  boot without rules).  There's still one issue that was also present with
  udev-175, which is that a hotplugged optical drive won't get symlinks
  unless it has been in at boot and had rules generated for it then.
  Otherwise, things are looking considerably better.  Firmware is loading
  correctly, rules are autogenerated properly again, and several devices
  that were missing in /dev have returned.
    So, there's the story.  Maybe more than you really wanted to know.  ;-)
  Thanks to rworkman for his help on this.  Please report any new problems.
  And if anyone knows how to get symlinks working for a hotplugged optical
  drive like they did in udev-165, a fix would be most appreciated.

Fri Jul 13 23:14:15 UTC 2012
It's Friday the 13th, and Mercury is going into retrograde...  seems like the
perfect time to break things!  A few notes are in order here...   first, we've
switched to using openssl-1.0.1c, which changes the major number for the
crypto and ssl libraries from .0 to .1, meaning everything linked with the
previous version of openssl will need to be recompiled.  The
lib{crypto,ssl}.so.0 libraries were backed up into aaa_elflibs, but this only
means that binaries linked with those libraries will start, not that SSL will
continue to work for them.  The hashing format in /etc/ssl/certs/ has changed,
so any programs linking to the old libraries will not be able to use them.
Next, Java has gone away due to licensing restrictions...  Finally, these
changes have broken Xfce as it exists in -current at the moment, but I'll try
to do something about that soon.  Thanks to Robby Workman and Eric Hameleers
for lots of help on these updates!

  Changes to configuration:
  CONFIG_SCSI_ISCSI_ATTRS=m
  # CONFIG_BCMA is not set
  CONFIG_BRCMSMAC=m
  CONFIG_SCSI_ISCSI_ATTRS was made modular since the iSCSI userspace will not
  work with it built in.  This change disallows building the QLogic 40xx
  (ISP4XXX) and 8022 (ISP82XX) into the huge kernel, but for the same reason
  those would not have worked for installation anyway.
  CONFIG_BCMA was turned off because including it prevents building the
  Broadcom BRCMSMAC driver, which is the only working choice for several
  adapters other than the proprietary wl driver.  Unfortunately, removing
  BCMA removes support for bcm4331 from the b43 driver.  However, adding the
  BRCMSMAC causes several new adaptors to gain support, including some that
  are becoming quite common in recent laptops, so overall this change should
  be a net gain.

xap/sane-1.0.22-x86_64-3.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Patched to fix compiling against v4l-utils.
  Changed udev rules to use group lp instead of scanner.  It turns out that
  this is likely what's been interfering with printer detection since we
  switched CUPS to use libusb instead of the usblp kernel module.  SANE
  would come along and switch the group on multifunction printer/scanners
  to "scanner", and then CUPS would no longer be able to use them.  The
  kernel module wasn't affected by this since it didn't use the raw USB
  device node and didn't care who owned it.  Anyway, making this switch
  gets things pretty close to how they were before.  The good news is that
  printers should be detected and configurable without having to look at
  lsusb output or writing custom udev rules, however, users will need to
  be in group lp in order to use the scanner.  We'll do this automatically
  for console logins.

a/kernel-huge-3.2.21-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  Removed built-in support for legacy Megaraid driver, as it interferes with
  the drivers for newer cards.  In fact, most Megaraid cards that are not
  _very_ old will work with the newer megaraid_box driver.  Systems older
  than that can still be upgraded to -current (or Slackware-next) and will
  work fine using megaraid.ko and an appropriate initrd (we will still

As you've possibly noticed by now, slackware.com is back on the air, and
I'd like to take this opportunity to give a hearty thanks to Mark Post of
Slack/390 fame for updating the PHP code to make it happen!  Eric Hameleers
and the rest of the crew also pitched in to help get it installed and
running on our other server.  Thanks as well to all the folks who emailed
with offers of hardware, help porting, and other support for the site.
We really appreciated it.  Viva la vie Slackware!

  Use the xscreensaver-getimage-file from xscreensaver-5.14.  The script
  in this version of xscreensaver requires libwww-perl, which has been
  unbundled into 14 separate modules.  Maybe we'll consider it eventually.

Still a few things in need of a rebuild for perl, such as perlkde,
perlqt, and linuxdoc-tools, but I'd rather not leave things in a
known-broken state so most everything else should be fixed now.
There's a couple of other updates, and a patch to glibc that I'm
hoping will fix the reported crashes with Google Chrome.
a/glibc-solibs-2.15-x86_64-3.txz:  Rebuilt.

  Always install the new rc.httpd.
n/php-5.4.3-x86_64-3.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Added --enable-maintainer-zts to the ./configure options.
  It seems that this option was automatically enabled on the 64-bit side,
  but not on 32-bit.  I'm still not entirely sure why that happened.  I
  had a few theories about it, like perhaps httpd was running when one of
  the PHP packages was compiled, but testing on 32-bit seemed to engage
  ZTS at random.  The only reliable way to make things work was to specify
  the option explicitly, so that's what has been done.  If it has to be
  one way or the other, I think we want a thread-safe PHP that will work
  with any httpd MPM.  Let me know if there are still any issues, but it
  should be working properly now.

Well, it appears that going from perl-5.14.x to perl-5.16.x did indeed
cause some packages that use perl to break.  The first two reports are
a couple of usual suspects, irssi and xchat.  Probably there are more
that need an upgrade or recompile, such as:  git, imagemagick, linuxdoc-tools,
net-snmp, obexftp, perlkde, perlqt, pidgin, pilot-link, subversion, and swig.
Confirmations on any of these appreciated.  I notice that some of these
also use Python, so maybe we should just go to Python-2.7.3 first and get
the breakage over with all at once?
ap/powertop-2.0-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.

Hey folks!  We've merged KDE 4.8.2 and a bunch of new packages that it
depends upon into -current, thanks in large part to months of work and
testing by Eric Hameleers.  Note that NetworkManager is included.  If
you want to use this, make sure to move the new rc.M into place,
make /etc/rc.d/rc.networkmanager executable, and then add the KDE
"Network Manager" widget to your desktop.  Have fun!  :-)
NOTE:  After upgrading, the following obsolete KDE packages should be removed:
  kdeaccessibility, kdebase, kdebase-runtime, kdebase-workspace,
  kdebindings, kdeedu, kdegraphics, kdeutils, koffice, konq-plugins,
  kopete-cryptography, polkit-kde-1, and all koffice-l10n-*.

  Use genuine GNU bash instead of busybox ash.  This fixes installer failure
  caused by exported variables such as TERM failing to propogate to subshells.
  I'm still not sure what's causing that issue (perhaps a change in glibc?),
  but using real bash might be better in the long run, as we won't need to
  avoid bashisms in the scripts.  The original reason bash was avoided was to
  keep things small for installer floppies, and we're well past that era.

In SeTpartitions, use -d single -m single as it increases performance by
about 15%, and multiple metadata copies are useless when using a btrfs

installer currently supports).  Thanks to Luigi Genoni.

  These are the main configuration changes from the 2.6.37.6 kernel in 13.37:
    BLK_DEV_LOOP y -> m
    LOG_BUF_SHIFT 15 -> 18
    MOUSE_PS2_ELANTECH n -> y
  And, compared with the 2.6.38.4 kernel in 13.37/testing:
    LOG_BUF_SHIFT 15 -> 18
    PREEMPT_NONE y -> n
    PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY n -> y
    SCHED_AUTOGROUP y -> n
  It remains to be seen where the PREEMPT_* options will settle in the future.
  SCHED_AUTOGROUP still seems sketchy to me, and might be behind some odd
  clockskew issues.  And, thanks to Carl Wenninger for reporting that the
  LOG_BUF_SHIFT setting was less than the kernel defaults and was leading to
  a few missing lines at the beginning of 'dmesg' output.

l/apr-1.4.4-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This fixes a possible denial of service due to an unconstrained, recursive
  invocation of apr_fnmatch().  This function has been reimplemented using a
  non-recursive algorithm.  Thanks to William Rowe.

n/httpd-2.2.18-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.

Slackware 13.37 x86_64 stable is released!

Thanks to everyone who pitched in on this release: the Slackware team,
the folks producing upstream code, and linuxquestions.org for providing
a great forum for collaboration and testing.

The ISOs are off to be replicated, a 6 CD-ROM 32-bit set and a dual-sided
32-bit/64-bit x86/x86_64 DVD.  Please consider supporting the Slackware
project by picking up a copy from store.slackware.com.  We're taking
pre-orders now, and offer a discount if you sign up for a subscription.

As always, thanks to the Slackware community for testing, suggestions,
and feedback.  :-)

Have fun!
