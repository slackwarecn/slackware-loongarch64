# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

ksystemlog:
ksystemlog: KSystemLog is a system log viewer tool. This program is developed for
ksystemlog: beginner users, who don't know how to find information about their
ksystemlog: Linux system, and don't know where log files are. It is also of course
ksystemlog: designed for advanced users, who quickly want to understand problems
ksystemlog: of their machine with a more powerful and graphical tool than
ksystemlog: 'tail -f' and 'less' commands ;-)
