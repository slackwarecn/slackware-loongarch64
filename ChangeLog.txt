Slackware 14.2 x86_64 stable is released!

The long development cycle (the Linux community has lately been living in
"interesting times", as they say) is finally behind us, and we're proud to
announce the release of Slackware 14.2.  The new release brings many updates
and modern tools, has switched from udev to eudev (no systemd), and adds
well over a hundred new packages to the system.  Thanks to the team, the
upstream developers, the dedicated Slackware community, and everyone else
who pitched in to help make this release a reality.

The ISOs are off to be replicated, a 6 CD-ROM 32-bit set and a dual-sided
32-bit/64-bit x86/x86_64 DVD.  Please consider supporting the Slackware
project by picking up a copy from store.slackware.com.  We're taking
pre-orders now, and offer a discount if you sign up for a subscription.

Have fun!  :-)

a/sysklogd-1.5.1-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Add a new -c option to disable suppression of repeated messages, which helps
  log parsing tools such as fail2ban work better.
ap/at-3.1.19-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Removed broken at_deny.5 man page symlink.

ap/screen-4.4.0-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
xfce/xfce4-pulseaudio-plugin-0.2.4-x86_64-3.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Reverted the icon background color patch, which was causing artifacts around
  the icon or other issues such as the icon being too wide.  These seemed
  worse than the background color issue, which at least doesn't affect the
  default Xfce theme.  The patch remains in the source directory, commented
  out in case anyone wants to try it.  Also, an alternate patch from
  Jean-Philippe Guillemin has been added to the source directory (commented
  out).

Sorry about the delay, but we had to wait for this kernel.  At least we were
able to get some other good fixes in this week while we were waiting.  :-)

d/kernel-headers-4.4.14-x86-1.txz:  Upgraded.
k/kernel-source-4.4.14-noarch-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This kernel release fixes two security issues:
  Corrupted offset allows for arbitrary decrements in compat
  IPT_SO_SET_REPLACE setsockopt.  Risk:  High.  Impact:  Kernel memory
  corruption, leading to elevation of privileges or kernel code execution.
  This occurs in a compat_setsockopt() call that is normally restricted to
  root, however, Linux 3/4 kernels that support user and network namespaces
  can allow an unprivileged user to trigger this functionality.  This is
  exploitable from inside a container.
  Out of bounds reads when processing IPT_SO_SET_REPLACE setsockopt.
  Risk:  Medium.  Impact:  Out of bounds heap memory access, leading to a
  Denial of Service (or possibly heap disclosure or further impact).
  This occurs in a setsockopt() call that is normally restricted to root,
  however, Linux 3/4 kernels that support user and network namespaces can
  allow an unprivileged user to trigger this functionality.  This is
  exploitable from inside a container.

l/pulseaudio-9.0-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This release fixes many bugs, including this one that was commonly reported
  during the Slackware 14.2 development cycle:
  "Automatic routing improvements:
  In 8.0, PulseAudio started to automatically switch to another profile when
  the device associated with the current profile is unplugged.  That seemingly
  smart thing had some serious unintended consequences.  One typical issue was
  that when unplugging headphones, PulseAudio might switch to S/PDIF output
  and not switch back to headphones when they are plugged in again.  Another
  issue was that HDMI in many cases appears to get temporarily unplugged when
  the monitor goes to sleep mode, or even when switching the refresh rate of
  the monitor -- PulseAudio 8.0 would move audio away from the HDMI monitor in
  these cases and not move the audio back to HDMI when the monitor becomes
  available again.  These issues are now fixed."

xfce/xfce4-pulseaudio-plugin-0.2.4-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.

  Thanks to Eugen Wissner.
a/mkinitrd-1.4.8-x86_64-7.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Fixed detecting USB partition in init, added proper USB storage modules
  to mkinitrd, and added missing USB keyboard modules to
  mkinitrd_command_generator.sh to fix entering LUKS password with some
  newer USB keyboards.  Thanks to Eric Hameleers.
a/sysvinit-scripts-2.0-noarch-33.txz:  Rebuilt.
  rc.S:  In cryptsetup script, support supplying a password of "none"
  (interactive entry) for non-swap partitions to allow specifying additional
  options.  Support a new option "discard" to pass the --allow-discards option
  to cryptsetup when unlocking a volume, which can potentially improve
  performance and longevity on some SSDs.  Thanks to Nathan Wallace.

  Patched to handle NULL returns from recent glibc crypt().  Thanks to nixi.
n/wget-1.18-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This version fixes a security vulnerability present in all old versions
  of wget.  On a server redirect from HTTP to a FTP resource, wget would
  trust the HTTP server and use the name in the redirected URL as the
  destination filename.  This behaviour was changed and now it works
  similarly as a redirect from HTTP to another HTTP resource so the original
  name is used as the destination file.  To keep the previous behaviour the
  user must provide --trust-server-names.
  The vulnerability was discovered by Dawid Golunski and was reported by
  Beyond Security's SecuriTeam.

  In setup.80.make-bootdisk, try to use syslinux-nomtools.  This is more

  use this flaw to advertise a node as a router, allowing them to
  perform man-in-the-middle attacks on a connecting client, or
  disrupt the network connectivity of that client.

  (2) evbuffer_expand, or (3) bufferevent_write function, which triggers a
  heap-based buffer overflow or an infinite loop.

n/NetworkManager-1.0.10-x86_64-5.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Patched rc.networkmanager to only attempt to kill wpa_supplicant on shutdown
  using the first .pid found in /var/run or /run.  Otherwise if those
  directories are symlinked or bind mounted together there will be a race
  condition that may result in an error message.
  I'm still not certain that rc.networkmanager should be messing with
  wpa_supplicant.  What about cases where NetworkManager might be configured to
  *not* manage the wireless interfaces at all?
  Luckily, there is rarely any reason for stopping NetworkManager (outside of
  shutdown or reboot), or for restarting it.

  benefit, all you need to do in order to build the latest version of vim is
  remove the existing tarball and run the SlackBuild again.  It will scrape the
  vim page at github for the latest version number and then fetch that version.

  Fixed weak key generation.  Due to a bug in the ephemeral secret key

  methods, ephemeral secret keys of size 128 bits are generated, instead
  of the recommended sizes of 1024 and 2048 bits, giving a practical
  security of 63 bits.

n/libssh2-1.7.0-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  Fixed weak key generation.  During the SSHv2 handshake when libssh2 is to
  get a suitable value for 'group order' in the Diffle Hellman negotiation,
  it would pass in number of bytes to a function that expected number of bits.
  This would result in the library generating numbers using only an 8th the
  number of random bits than what were intended: 128 or 256 bits instead of
  1023 or 2047.  Using such drastically reduced amount of random bits for
  Diffie Hellman weakended the handshake security significantly.

l/alsa-lib-1.1.0-x86_64-3.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Changed the default /etc/asound.conf.new to use a different configuration
  for PulseAudio that is less likely to cause issues than the previous one,
  especially on machines where the analog output is not recognized as card 0
  by the BIOS.  Thanks to Ryan P.C. McQuen who went above and beyond on this
  bug report by convincing upstream to recommend this on their website in
  order to convince me to make the change.  :-)
l/glibc-2.23-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update contains security fixes and improvements.
  Of the security fixes, the most important and well-publicized is the
  stack-based buffer overflow in libresolv that could allow specially
  crafted DNS responses to seize control of execution flow in the DNS
  client (CVE-2015-7547).  However, due to a patch applied to Slackware's
  glibc back in 2009 (don't use the gethostbyname4() lookup method as it
  was causing some cheap routers to misbehave), we were not vulnerable to
  that issue.  The rest of the fixed security issues are less critical.

ap/ghostscript-9.07-x86_64-3.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Reverted back to ghostscript-9.07, since any newer version causes the GIMP
  ps plugin to crash when attempting to import a .ps or .eps file.  Whatever
  is causing the problem happened between gs-9.07 and gs-9.09, and is probably
  also dependent on the libraries in use and perhaps the compiler, since some
  other distributions appear to be using the latest ghostscript without issues.
  If anyone can figure it out, hints are welcome.  Meanwhile this gets
  everything working again.

  This update fixes a security issue where NTLM credentials are not checked
  for proxy connection reuse.  The effects of this flaw is that the application
  could be reusing a proxy connection using the previously used credentials
  and thus it could be given to or prevented access from resources that it
  wasn't intended to.  Thanks to Isaac Boukris.

  And yes, if you're allergic to PulseAudio that means you might also need to
  disable /etc/xdg/autostart/pulseaudio.desktop...

Hey folks, happy new year!
After upgrading to BlueZ 5 recently, everything seemed to be working great,
but then it was pointed out that Bluetooth audio was no longer working.
The reason was that the newer BlueZ branch had dropped ALSA support and now
required PulseAudio.  So with some trepidation, we began investigating adding
PulseAudio to Slackware.  Going back to BlueZ 4 wasn't an option with various
dependent projects either having dropped support for it, or considering doing
so.  After several iterations here refining the foundation packages and
recompiling and tweaking other packages to use PulseAudio, it's working well
and you'll likely not notice much of a change.  But if you're using Bluetooth
audio, or needing to direct audio through HDMI, you'll probably find it a lot
easier to accomplish that.
Best of all, we're finally a modern, relevant Linux distro!  ;-)
Thanks to Mario Preksavec, Heinz Wiesinger, and Robby Workman for a lot of
help and testing.  Bug reports, complaints, and threats can go to me.
Also, enjoy a shiny new LTS 4.4.0 kernel and consider this 14.2 beta 1.

fix packages on 32-bit that were needlessly linking the old libudev.so.0.
Thanks to bormant for spotting these.  After rebuilding them, they no longer
link to libudev at all...  Since this got us close to having Xfce built
entirely for 586 on 32-bit, those packages were rebuilt as well.

We've made the switch from udev to eudev, and everything seems to be working
perfectly.  Big thanks to the eudev team for helping us bring Slackware's
udev up to date!  Make sure you remove the old udev and install both of the
new packages (eudev and libgudev), and then the changeover to eudev should
go as smooth as silk.  Really, the icu4c upgrade seemed more disruptive.  :)
A reboot after this is probably better than "/etc/rc.d/rc.udev force-restart",
but that worked fine here, too.  It would also be a good idea to regenerate
the initrd so that it uses eudev, but once again things worked fine here
either way.  Have fun!

  Patched makepkg and removepkg to support spaces in symlinks.  Spaces in file
  and directory names also work, so support should be complete.
  Thanks to Erik Jan Tromp.
  Patched makepkg to ensure that the root of a package is chmod 755.
  Patched installpkg to speed up several parts of the script, especially when
  symlinks are created by an install script.  If bash is available, install
  scripts will be translated to avoid spawning two subshells per link.
  Also, reduced UUOC!  :-)
  Patched removepkg to speed up several parts of the script.
  Thanks to Stuart Winter and Jim Hawkins.
  Patched upgradepkg to speed up several parts of the script by using native
  bash rather than calling out to sed.  (Similar changes might be applied to
  installpkg/removepkg in the future, but upgradepkg looping against the full
  set of packages is where the most improvement is seen)

n/bind-9.10.2_P4-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes two denial-of-service vulnerabilities:
  + CVE-2015-5722 is a denial-of-service vector which can be
  exploited remotely against a BIND server that is performing
  validation on DNSSEC-signed records.  Validating recursive
  resolvers are at the greatest risk from this defect, but it has not
  been ruled out that it could be exploited against an
  authoritative-only nameserver under limited conditions.  Servers
  that are not performing validation are not vulnerable.  However,
  ISC does not recommend disabling validation as a workaround to
  this issue as it exposes the server to other types of attacks.
  Upgrading to the patched versions is the recommended solution.
  All versions of BIND since 9.0.0 are vulnerable to CVE-2015-5722.
  + CVE-2015-5986 is a denial-of-service vector which can be used
  against a BIND server that is performing recursion.  Validation
  is not required.  Recursive resolvers are at the greatest risk
  from this defect, but it has not been ruled out that it could
  be exploited against an authoritative-only nameserver under
  limited conditions.
  Only versions of BIND since 9.9.7 and 9.10.2 are vulnerable to
  CVE-2015-5986.

n/bind-9.10.2_P3-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes a security issue where an error in the handling of TKEY
  queries can be exploited by an attacker for use as a denial-of-service
  vector, as a constructed packet can use the defect to trigger a REQUIRE
  assertion failure, causing BIND to exit.
  Impact:
  Both recursive and authoritative servers are vulnerable to this defect.
  Additionally, exposure is not prevented by either ACLs or configuration
  options limiting or denying service because the exploitable code occurs
  early in the packet handling, before checks enforcing those boundaries.
  Operators should take steps to upgrade to a patched version as soon as
  possible.

n/openssl-1.0.1p-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes the following security issue:
  Alternative chains certificate forgery (CVE-2015-1793).
  During certificate verification, OpenSSL (starting from version 1.0.1n and
  1.0.2b) will attempt to find an alternative certificate chain if the first
  attempt to build such a chain fails.  An error in the implementation of this
  logic can mean that an attacker could cause certain checks on untrusted
  certificates to be bypassed, such as the CA flag, enabling them to use a
  valid leaf certificate to act as a CA and "issue" an invalid certificate.
  This issue will impact any application that verifies certificates including
  SSL/TLS/DTLS clients and SSL/TLS/DTLS servers using client authentication.
  This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2c, 1.0.2b, 1.0.1n and 1.0.1o.
  This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 24th June 2015 by Adam Langley/David
  Benjamin (Google/BoringSSL).  The fix was developed by the BoringSSL project.

  This release fixes bugs and a couple of security issues:
  CWE-911: Improper Update of Reference Count - CVE-2015-1158
    This bug could allow an attacker to upload a replacement CUPS
    configuration file and mount further attacks.
  CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation
  (Cross-site Scripting) - CVE-2015-1159
    A cross-site scripting bug in the CUPS templating engine allows this
    bug to be exploited when a user browses the web.  In certain cases,
    the CGI template can echo user input to file rather than escaping the
    text first.  This may be used to set up a reflected XSS attack in
    the QUERY parameter of the web interface help page.

  This update fixes a security issue where an attacker who can cause
  a validating resolver to query a zone containing specifically constructed
  contents can cause that resolver to fail an assertion and terminate due
  to a defect in validation code.  This means that a recursive resolver that
  is performing DNSSEC validation can be deliberately stopped by an attacker
  who can cause the resolver to perform a query against a
  maliciously-constructed zone.  This will result in a denial of service to
  clients who rely on that resolver.

n/ntp-4.2.8p3-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes a security issue where under specific circumstances an
  attacker can send a crafted packet to cause a vulnerable ntpd instance to
  crash.  Since this requires 1) ntpd set up to allow remote configuration
  (not allowed by default), and 2) knowledge of the configuration password,
  and 3) access to a computer entrusted to perform remote configuration,
  the vulnerability is considered low-risk.

Greetings!  It has indeed been far too long.  I apologize for the absence
of updates lately, but we've been using the time to get some good work done.
This is not a beta (probably not even an alpha release yet), but it is also
not a drill.  ;-)  We've spared you all most of the pain while we
transitioned to a lot of new libraries that got major version number bumps,
and have tested everything to ensure that this will be a smooth upgrade.
Still, I'd be surprised if all this didn't introduce any regressions, so if
you find any problems let us know.  Huge thanks are due to Robby Workman,
Heinz Wiesinger, Eric Hameleers, and Stuart Winter for all the help.  Have fun!

  This update is a security release in order to address CVE-2014-8143
  (Elevation of privilege to Active Directory Domain Controller).
  Samba's AD DC allows the administrator to delegate creation of user or
  computer accounts to specific users or groups.  However, all released
  versions of Samba's AD DC did not implement the additional required
  check on the UF_SERVER_TRUST_ACCOUNT bit in the userAccountControl
  attributes.  Most Samba deployments are not of the AD Domain Controller,
  but are of the classic domain controller, the file server or print server.
  Only the Active Directory Domain Controller is affected by this issue.
  Additionally, most sites running the AD Domain Controller do not configure
  delegation for the creation of user or computer accounts, and so are not
  vulnerable to this issue, as no writes are permitted to the
  userAccountControl attribute, no matter what the value.

  (* Security fix *)
n/openssl-1.0.1j-x86_64-1.tx:  Upgraded.
  This update fixes several security issues:
  SRTP Memory Leak (CVE-2014-3513):
    A flaw in the DTLS SRTP extension parsing code allows an attacker, who
    sends a carefully crafted handshake message, to cause OpenSSL to fail
    to free up to 64k of memory causing a memory leak. This could be
    exploited in a Denial Of Service attack.
  Session Ticket Memory Leak (CVE-2014-3567):
    When an OpenSSL SSL/TLS/DTLS server receives a session ticket the
    integrity of that ticket is first verified. In the event of a session
    ticket integrity check failing, OpenSSL will fail to free memory
    causing a memory leak. By sending a large number of invalid session
    tickets an attacker could exploit this issue in a Denial Of Service
    attack.
  SSL 3.0 Fallback protection:
    OpenSSL has added support for TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV to allow applications
    to block the ability for a MITM attacker to force a protocol
    downgrade.
    Some client applications (such as browsers) will reconnect using a
    downgraded protocol to work around interoperability bugs in older
    servers. This could be exploited by an active man-in-the-middle to
    downgrade connections to SSL 3.0 even if both sides of the connection
    support higher protocols. SSL 3.0 contains a number of weaknesses
    including POODLE (CVE-2014-3566).
  Build option no-ssl3 is incomplete (CVE-2014-3568):
    When OpenSSL is configured with "no-ssl3" as a build option, servers
    could accept and complete a SSL 3.0 handshake, and clients could be
    configured to send them.

a/bash-4.3.027-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  Another bash update.  Here's some information included with the patch:
    "This patch changes the encoding bash uses for exported functions to avoid
    clashes with shell variables and to avoid depending only on an environment
    variable's contents to determine whether or not to interpret it as a shell
    function."
  After this update, an environment variable will not go through the parser
  unless it follows this naming structure:  BASH_FUNC_*%%
  Most scripts never expected to import functions from environment variables,
  so this change (although not backwards compatible) is not likely to break
  many existing scripts.  It will, however, close off access to the parser as
  an attack surface in the vast majority of cases.  There's already another
  vulnerability similar to CVE-2014-6271 for which there is not yet a fix,
  but this hardening patch prevents it (and likely many more similar ones).
  Thanks to Florian Weimer and Chet Ramey.

  This update fixes the following security issues:
  *) SECURITY: CVE-2014-0117 (cve.mitre.org)
     mod_proxy: Fix crash in Connection header handling which
     allowed a denial of service attack against a reverse proxy
     with a threaded MPM.  [Ben Reser]
  *) SECURITY: CVE-2014-0118 (cve.mitre.org)
     mod_deflate: The DEFLATE input filter (inflates request bodies) now
     limits the length and compression ratio of inflated request bodies to
     avoid denial of sevice via highly compressed bodies.  See directives
     DeflateInflateLimitRequestBody, DeflateInflateRatioLimit,
     and DeflateInflateRatioBurst. [Yann Ylavic, Eric Covener]
  *) SECURITY: CVE-2014-0226 (cve.mitre.org)
     Fix a race condition in scoreboard handling, which could lead to
     a heap buffer overflow.  [Joe Orton, Eric Covener]
  *) SECURITY: CVE-2014-0231 (cve.mitre.org)
     mod_cgid: Fix a denial of service against CGI scripts that do
     not consume stdin that could lead to lingering HTTPD child processes
     filling up the scoreboard and eventually hanging the server.  By
     default, the client I/O timeout (Timeout directive) now applies to
     communication with scripts.  The CGIDScriptTimeout directive can be
     used to set a different timeout for communication with scripts.
     [Rainer Jung, Eric Covener, Yann Ylavic]

Enjoy some new X related updates!  Thanks to Robby Workman for lots of help
on the X.Org upgrades, and to alienBOB for an earlier SlackBuild for Motif
that I used as a reference for configure options and other fixes.
You can blame me for picking xorg-server-1.15.2 over xorg-server-1.14.7.  ;-)
If you're using a proprietary video driver you'll probably need to recompile it
for the new X server...  if you can.

ap/lxc-1.0.3-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This adds a template for for lxc-create to create a minimal Slackware
  container using slackpkg.  For example, this will create a container
  named "current":
    lxc-create -n current -t slackware
  There's an rc.lxc init script added to autorun/autostop containers, but it's
  not currently hooked in to the main init scripts, so if you want to use it
  you'll need to add it to your rc.local and rc.local_shutdown (and make it
  executable).  The script will look for "lxc.start.auto = 1" in the container
  config file to determine if a container should be autostarted (1) or not (0).

  This update fixes bugs and security issues, including a flaw in Samba's

  a flaw in SRV_SNAPSHOT_ARRAY that permits attackers to leverage
  configurations that use shadow_copy* for vfs objects to reveal potentially
  private server information, a denial of service on the nmbd NetBIOS name

  locking out Samba accounts after a number of bad password attempts.
  However, all released versions of Samba did not implement this check for
  password changes, such as are available over multiple SAMR and RAP
  interfaces, allowing password guessing attacks.
  CVE-2013-6442:
  Samba versions 4.0.0 and above have a flaw in the smbcacls command. If
  smbcacls is used with the "-C|--chown name" or "-G|--chgrp name"
  command options it will remove the existing ACL on the object being

a/shadow-4.1.5.1-x86_64-3.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Shadow 4.1.5 addressed a tty-hijacking vulnerability in "su -c"
  (CVE-2005-4890) by detaching the controlling terminal in the non-PAM
  case via a TIOCNOTTY request.  Bi-directional protection is excessive
  and breaks a commonly-used methods for privilege escalation on non-PAM
  systems (e.g. xterm -e /bin/su -s /bin/bash -c /bin/bash myscript).
  This update relaxes the restriction and only detaches the controlling
  tty when the callee is not root (which is, after all, the threat vector).
  Thanks to mancha for the patch (and the above information).
ap/mariadb-5.5.35-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.

  (* Security fix *)
n/ntp-4.2.6p5-x86_64-5.txz:  Rebuilt.
  All stable versions of NTP remain vulnerable to a remote attack where the
  "ntpdc -c monlist" command can be used to amplify network traffic as part
  of a denial of service attack.  By default, Slackware is not vulnerable
  since it includes "noquery" as a default restriction.  However, it is
  vulnerable if this restriction is removed.  To help mitigate this flaw,
  "disable monitor" has been added to the default ntp.conf (which will disable
  the monlist command even if other queries are allowed), and the default
  restrictions have been extended to IPv6 as well.
  All users of the NTP daemon should make sure that their ntp.conf contains
  "disable monitor" to prevent misuse of the NTP service.  The new ntp.conf
  file will be installed as /etc/ntp.conf.new with a package upgrade, but the
  changes will need to be merged into any existing ntp.conf file by the admin.

Slackware 14.1 x86_64 stable is released!

It's been another interesting release cycle here at Slackware bringing
new features like support for UEFI machines, updated compilers and
development tools, the switch from MySQL to MariaDB, and many more
improvements throughout the system.  Thanks to the team, the upstream
developers, the dedicated Slackware community, and everyone else who
pitched in to help make this release a reality.

The ISOs are off to be replicated, a 6 CD-ROM 32-bit set and a dual-sided
32-bit/64-bit x86/x86_64 DVD.  Please consider supporting the Slackware
project by picking up a copy from store.slackware.com.  We're taking
pre-orders now, and offer a discount if you sign up for a subscription.

Have fun!  :-)
